"""Substitution proposals for a drug active site.

Written against the danuglipron / GLP-1R prototype (2026-09-19), whose findings
these tests encode:

  * The PHARMACOPHORE gate cannot reject a substituent scan -- swapping an
    aromatic CH cannot break an acid, a fused diazole, a basic amine or a
    nitrile. MEASURED 54/54 kept. It belongs on SCAFFOLD moves.
  * The LIABILITY gate cannot rank one either, because the PARENT already
    violates Lipinski (danuglipron is MW 555.6). MEASURED 0/54 clean.
  * What DOES discriminate is the CHANGE relative to the parent.

So the module's contract is: enumerate, then score RELATIVELY. These tests pin
that contract and the two negative results that motivate it.
