"""Tests for analogue 3D embedding.

The failure mode worth guarding: an analogue that CANNOT be embedded (strained
ring, bad valence, untypable atom for MMFF) must report `usable == False` and
carry an explanatory `error`. If it instead came back with zero conformers and
no error, a downstream ranking would treat it as evaluated-and-unremarkable
rather than not-evaluated -- the same fabrication class as `tools/tox`'s 0.0.
