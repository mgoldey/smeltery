"""Tests for the multi-format structure reader.

The load-bearing claim this module makes is in its docstring: every format
converges on ONE Rust parser, so two files describing the same geometry give a
bit-identical `Molecule`. `test_pdb_and_xyz_agree_bitwise` is that claim's
falsifier -- it fails if anyone adds a second conversion path or a unit
constant of their own.

Ported from ferric's `tools/structure/tests` (pinned 8637a5d), with two changes:
`charge` and `multiplicity` are now required arguments, so each call states
them; and the Rust-table cross-check needs `FERRIC_SRC`.

Tests that need the compiled `ferric` extension skip cleanly when it is absent;
the format layer itself is tested through `read_structure`, which never imports
it, so a missing extension does not silently delete coverage of the parsers.

    the test exists to catch.

    fixture is written to match; this compares the PIPELINES, not the formats'
    differing precision.

        `    1SOLVECLXYZ    1   1.000   2.000   3.000`

    A whitespace split sees `['1SOLVECLXYZ', '1', '1.000', ...]` and takes the
    ATOM INDEX as the atom name, so the element comes out of a bare `1`. The
    columns say `CLXYZ` -> chlorine.

    This test was rewritten once: the first version used a five-digit index
    with a short atom name (`OW112345`), which a split also mangles -- but only
    by appending digits, and the element heuristic stops at the first
    non-letter, so `split()` still produced the right element and the test
    PASSED against a deliberately broken reader. Truncation that does not
    change the answer is not a discriminating case.
