"""End-to-end: enumerate danuglipron isomers, funnel them through all four tiers.

This is the pipeline the campaign lacked. Previously: 11 hand-written analogues,
scored by tier 3 alone, on geometries that had never seen the receptor
(RESULTS.md M7). Now: enumerated candidates, docked, relaxed, GFN2-ranked, and
finally DFT'd -- with every tier's survivors, rejects and failures recorded.

## Cost, measured on this box

    tier 1  Vina           26.4 s/dock at exhaustiveness 4, cpu=0 (MEASURED)
                           109.0 s at cpu=1 -- but 10 run concurrently, x3 seeds
    tier 2  MMFF94         ~ms
    tier 3  GFN2-xTB       ~0.5 s single point
    tier 4  ferric DFT     612.4 s / 18 iterations, converged, at 71 atoms
                           (MEASURED 2026-09-02; the earlier ">57 min, did not
                           finish" was memory contention, not cost -- M10)

**Tier 1 dominates, not tier 4.** It is the only tier that touches every
candidate: 60 ligands x 26.4 s is ~26 min, while tier 4 sees KEEPS[-1]=3 and
costs ~31 min. Those are the same order, which is what a well-balanced funnel
looks like -- and is only visible because every tier is now TIMED. The previous
run recorded a single 3326 s total and no way to attribute it.

Exhaustiveness is 4, not 16: measured on this target, 4 / 8 / 16 differ by
<=0.03 A in redock RMSD against a 0.13 A between-seed SEM, so the extra search
buys nothing resolvable at 2.6x the price (RESULTS.md M11).

## What to look for in the output

The interesting question is not which candidate wins -- no ranking is licensed
until the fit metric itself is validated (RESULTS.md M5). It is whether **tier 4
reorders tier 3's survivors**. If DFT changes the order, the cheap tiers cannot
substitute for it. If it does not, tier 4 is skippable for this system, which is
equally worth knowing and much cheaper to act on.
