"""Arms A/B: pocket electrostatic fit for the parent ensemble and the analogues.

Pipeline per candidate:
  1. embed SMILES -> conformers (RDKit ETKDGv3 + MMFF94, fixed seed)
  2. align each conformer's MCS scaffold onto the 7LCJ bound pose (Kabsch)
  3. GFN2-xTB vacuum and in-pocket-field single points at that geometry
  4. report the best (most negative) interaction energy

Then the metric GATE: the two pharmacophore-breaking negative controls must
score clearly worse than the parent. If they do not, the fit metric is tracking
molecular size and no candidate ranking is reported.

# 1/sqrt(n) -- 5.66 -> 3.33 -> 1.99 -> 1.35 kcal/mol at n = 5, 10, 20, 40 -- so
# the poses ARE samples from one distribution and averaging does converge. 40
# poses gives ~1.4 kcal/mol precision, which is the scale needed to resolve a
# pharmacophore contact. 6 (the earlier value) gave ~5 kcal/mol and could not.
# Raised 40 -> 100 after a power analysis on the n=40 data (2026-08-29). The
# parent-vs-NC2 gap is 17.8 kcal/mol against per-pose standard deviations of
# 46-50, so resolving that pair at 2 sigma needs
#   n >= 4*(sd_p^2 + sd_n^2)/gap^2 = 59
# poses per candidate. 100 clears it with margin.
#
# What this does NOT fix, and the number is worth writing down: the smallest gap
# worth resolving among the real candidates (parent vs H1b, 1.4 kcal/mol) would
# need n >= 7350. Sampling can rescue the metric GATE (a control that must be
# grossly separated) but cannot rescue a fine-grained candidate RANKING. That
# separation is the point of running this -- see RESULTS.md M4.
