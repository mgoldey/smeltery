"""Does relaxing a pose IN the pocket field tighten the fit distribution?

## The question

`run_fit.py` scores rigid, MCS-overlaid poses. Their per-pose fit spread is
~46-50 kcal/mol (sd), which is what makes the estimator imprecise: a rigid
overlay drops an analogue's scaffold onto the parent's placement with no chance
to settle, so some poses land in clashing or badly-oriented local arrangements
that a real bound complex would never adopt.

If the spread is dominated by such unrelaxed poses, then relaxing each pose in
the pocket's point-charge field should pull them toward a common basin and
SHRINK the distribution. If instead the spread is real conformational diversity
of genuinely distinct binding arrangements, relaxation will move energies down
but leave the spread roughly intact.

Those two predictions differ, so the probe is admissible.

## Artifact hypothesis, stated before measuring

- *If relaxation genuinely helps:* sd falls substantially AND the relaxed poses
  converge toward fewer distinct geometries (lower pairwise RMSD spread).
- *If it is an artifact:* sd falls simply because every pose collapses onto the
  SAME geometry regardless of where it started -- which would mean we are no
  longer sampling poses at all, just re-finding one minimum. That would show up
  as near-zero RMSD spread among relaxed poses, and it would make the "improved
  precision" meaningless.

So the probe records BOTH the energy spread and the geometric spread. Reporting
only the energy spread could not distinguish them.
