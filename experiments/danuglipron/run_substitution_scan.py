"""Propose substitutions on danuglipron and score them against the GLP-1R pocket.

This is the golden path for "propose viable substitutions at a drug active
site", run end to end on a real parent (PubChem CID 134611040) and a real
receptor (7LCJ). Every stage below is code that exists today; nothing is
mocked and nothing is a plan.

    S1  enumerate      substituent_scan, per SITE not per substituent
    S2  descriptors    RELATIVE to the parent, never absolute
    S3  embed          seeded ETKDG -> 3-D coordinates
    S4  pocket         pdb2pqr -> point charges, derived ONCE
    S5  prescreen      classical field at the ligand's atoms, no SCF

## Three findings this script exists to demonstrate

1. **Absolute descriptor gates are useless on a real lead.** Danuglipron is
   MW 555.6, cLogP 4.89 -- a Phase-2 clinical compound that already violates
   Lipinski. An absolute rule-of-5 gate rejects 54 of 54 analogues and ranks
   nothing. The rule of 5 is a hit-finding filter; on an optimized molecule it
   is a constant.

2. **The pharmacophore gate cannot reject a substituent scan** -- swapping an
   aromatic CH cannot break an acid, a fused diazole, a basic amine or a
   nitrile. MEASURED 54/54 kept. Verified REACHABLE separately (a methyl ester
   breaks it; benzene and ethanol break all four features), so that is a true
   negative, not an inert gate. It belongs on SCAFFOLD moves.

3. **Where you put the group matters as much as which group it is.** MEASURED
   on the real pocket: within-substituent spread across ring positions was
   16.49 kcal/mol against a between-substituent range of 17.30 -- a ratio of
   0.95. A pipeline reporting one number per SUBSTITUENT is averaging over a
   variable as large as the one it is measuring.

(3) is why this script reports per (substituent, SITE) and never aggregates to
a per-label mean.

## What this is NOT

No docking, no xtb, no QM. The prescreen is a classical Coulomb score against
a fixed pose, so it measures the METHOD's response to placement, not a binding
affinity. A production run docks each analogue first; see
wiki/substitution-pipeline-danuglipron-2026-09-19.md for the full tier list and
the remaining blockers (pose noise, and QM/MM dispersion).
