    # its time paging until the kernel OOM-killed it. It measured contention.

    # Cost driver, for estimating a new candidate: vxc.rs assembles V_xc with
    # an O(nbf^2 x npts) GEMM EVERY iteration, and ferric's grid is 75x110 per
    # ATOM, so nbf and atom count both matter and the basis alone does not
    # predict cost. See tools/pipeline/cost.py. The iteration count is a

    # molecule in 18.
