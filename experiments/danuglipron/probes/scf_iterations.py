"""Report SCF ITERATIONS and exit reason, not just wall time.

Tier 4's cost anomaly survived elimination of size, basis, composition,
charge, and AO-cache batching (RESULTS.md M10). What remains is SCF
convergence behaviour, and wall time alone cannot distinguish:

  * few iterations, each expensive  -> the grid/basis is the cost
  * many iterations, each cheap     -> convergence is the cost

Those have opposite fixes, so the iteration count is the discriminator.

Requires the `iterations` / `exit_reason` getters on PyDftResult
(`cargo build --release -p ferric-python`).

RUN ON AN UNCONTENDED BOX, under `scripts/ferric-limited`, and PIN the memory
budget: ferric's auto-detect reads *live* MemAvailable, so an unrelated job
shrinks the budget and can flip the AO-cache path mid-comparison. A run on
2026-09-02 resolved 7.26 GB instead of the expected ~9.6 GB for exactly that
reason.

Usage:
