"""What does docking thoroughness actually buy, and what does it cost?

`exhaustiveness` is tier 1's dominant cost knob and the least justified number
in the pipeline. Two different values are in use with no measurement behind
either:

  * `dock_ligand`'s default is **32**, justified in its docstring as "the
    failure being fixed is a SEARCH failure, and under-searching would
    reproduce it" -- a reasonable prior, never tested.
  * the screening pipeline runs at **16**, chosen for speed.

So the setting VALIDATED by redocking (32 -> 0.95 A, RESULTS.md M9) is not the
setting used to screen. This probe closes that gap by measuring both axes on
the one system where ground truth exists.

## The design

Redock danuglipron into 7LCJ at a range of exhaustiveness values and record,
for each: wall seconds, best-of-N RMSD to the crystal pose, and top-ranked
RMSD. The ligand is re-embedded from SMILES each time with a fixed seed, so the
search starts from a geometry carrying no information about the answer.

**Artifact hypothesis, written before running.** If thoroughness genuinely
matters, RMSD should fall with exhaustiveness and plateau somewhere. If the
pose is easy for this pocket, RMSD is flat from the cheapest setting up -- and
16 vs 32 is a pure waste of half the tier-1 budget. Those predict different
curves, so the experiment can distinguish them.

A THIRD outcome is possible and would be the most interesting: RMSD flat but
top-1 RANK unstable, meaning the search finds the pose reliably and the scoring
function orders it by luck. That is M9's finding (r(score,RMSD)=+0.461) showing
up as a function of search effort.

Seeds: Vina's search is stochastic. One seed per setting measures a single
draw, so `--repeats` runs several seeds and reports the spread. A single-seed
sweep would report noise as trend -- the exact error this campaign made once
already by reading a pose RANGE as a precision (RESULTS.md M6).

Usage:
    uv run --no-sync python experiments/danuglipron/probes/exhaustiveness_sweep.py \
        [--levels 4,8,16,32] [--repeats 3] [--n-poses 20]
