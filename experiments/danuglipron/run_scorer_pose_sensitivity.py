"""M14: is any AVAILABLE scorer less pose-sensitive than pose_fit?

## Why

M4-M13 closed every pose PROTOCOL: more poses (sd flat in n), relaxing them
(15%), docking them (1%), and selecting one (10x worse than averaging). The
conclusion those four leave is that the per-pose scatter is a property of the
SCORING METRIC, not of the poses -- so the remaining lever is a different
metric.

This tests that directly, on the cheapest possible experiment: take the SAME 15
docked geometries M12 already produced and score them with every scorer this
repo has. If one is materially less pose-sensitive, it is the candidate for
tier 3. If none is, the lever is not in this repo and that is worth knowing
before building anything.

## The comparison must be DIMENSIONLESS

M12's headline error was comparing a Vina-score sd (0.83) against an xtb sd
(28.75) and reporting a "35x reduction" that was a scale difference. Two
scorers on different scales have incomparable standard deviations, full stop.

So the figure of merit here is the COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION, sd/|mean|, which
is dimensionless and comparable across scorers. A scorer that is 10x smaller in
magnitude AND 10x smaller in sd has learned nothing.

Reported alongside it, because CV alone can mislead when a mean sits near zero:
the RANGE/|mean| ratio, and the raw numbers so a reader can check.

## THE ARTIFACT HYPOTHESIS, stated before running

* **If some scorer is genuinely less pose-sensitive** -- its CV is materially
  below pose_fit's, AND its pose-to-pose RANKING correlates with pose_fit's
  (Spearman well above 0). The second half matters: a scorer can be smooth
  because it is insensitive to everything, including the chemistry, and a flat
  constant has CV 0 while being useless.

* **If it is an artifact of scale** -- the CV looks better but the ranking
  correlation is ~0, i.e. the scorer is smooth because it is not measuring the
  same thing. That is Vina's failure mode (r = +0.461 vs RMSD, and its own
  sd 0.83 against xtb's 28.75 on identical geometries).

These predict opposite things about the correlation, so the experiment can
distinguish them. Both are reported whatever the outcome.

## Scope

One candidate (the parent), 15 poses, one pocket. This characterises SCATTER,
not accuracy: none of these scorers has been validated against measured
affinities, and this probe does not change that.
