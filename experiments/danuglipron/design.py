"""Danuglipron (PF-06882961): the designed analogue set and its pharmacophore.

THE EXPERIMENT'S HYPOTHESES. The generic machinery -- `Analogue`,
`PharmacophoreSpec`, embedding -- lives in `tools/morph`. What is here is
specific to this campaign and belongs with it: the parent structure, the GLP-1R
pharmacophore, and the nine designed analogues plus two negative controls.

## Why these analogues

Measured starting point (`RESULTS.md` M1): danuglipron trips **zero** structural
alerts across Brenk, PAINS, NIH, Glaxo, Dundee and BMS. Its only developability
flag is **MW 555.6 > 500**, with **cLogP 4.89** at the rule-of-5 limit.

That reframes the problem, and contradicts the obvious first guess:

- The clinical failure was **not** a structural toxicophore. Pfizer's April 2025
  discontinuation followed a **single asymptomatic, reversible** DILI case, with
  liver-enzyme elevation rates "in line with approved agents in the class" across
  >1400 participants. The dose-limiting, program-defining problem was
  **dose-dependent GI intolerability**, which is an **exposure** problem.
- So the tractable lever is **reducing the dose needed for efficacy**, not
  deleting a toxicophore that is not there.

Three exposure-side hypotheses follow:

  **H1 (size/lipophilicity).** Trim MW below 500 and cLogP below 5 while keeping
  every pharmacophore contact. Lower dose for equal free-fraction exposure.
  **H2 (metabolic soft spots).** Block the benzylic ether and oxetane positions
  most likely to drive oxidative clearance and reactive-metabolite formation --
  the mechanistic route to idiosyncratic DILI, the one liability that IS
  structural even though no catalog flags it.
  **H3 (acid bioisosteres).** Replace the carboxylic acid, which drives potency
  but also acyl-glucuronide formation, with bioisosteres that keep the anionic
  contact but cannot form an acyl glucuronide.

## The constraint

The cryo-EM structure (PDB 7LCJ / 7S15) shows the pocket requires the
primate-specific **Trp33**, and the carboxylic acid is the potency-critical
anchor. Every analogue declares what must survive.

## READ THIS BEFORE REUSING ANY FIT NUMBER

`RESULTS.md` M7: candidate **pose generation failed** for this set. No generated
conformer reaches the bound pose within the conventional 2.0 A bar (best 2.23 A).
The analogue DESIGNS below are unaffected -- they are 2D hypotheses -- but every
3D fit number computed from them measures pose error rather than chemistry.

# The features the GLP-1R pocket actually needs, per the cryo-EM structures:
#  - an anionic/acid-like H-bond acceptor cluster (the potency anchor). Written
#    as a recursive-SMARTS union so acid BIOISOSTERES also satisfy it -- an
#    exact [CX3](=O)[OX2H1] would fail every H3 analogue by construction, which
#    would make the whole H3 arm untestable (a pass condition that cannot be
#    reached is arithmetic, not measurement).
#  - the benzimidazole (or an aza-equivalent) core.
#  - the basic piperidine nitrogen linker.
#  - an aromatic nitrile or equivalent electron-poor aryl terminus that packs
#    against the Trp33 region.
