"""M16: does GFN2-xTB RANK conformers the way DFT does?

## Why this is the missing number

The golden path costs tier 3 (~0.5 s/pose) and says it "ranks survivors". The
only accuracy claim attached to it is a **143 kcal/mol** anion/neutral split --
a split so large that resolving it says almost nothing about whether xtb can
order two conformers a few kcal/mol apart, which is what ranking survivors
actually means.

This measures that directly: score the same conformer set with GFN2-xTB and
with ferric's DFT, and compare the ORDERINGS.

## Why rank correlation, not energy agreement

Absolute xtb and DFT energies are not comparable -- different Hamiltonians,
different zeros. Even their differences carry a systematic offset. What tier 3
is asked for is an ORDER: which survivors go up to tier 4. So the figure of
merit is Spearman rank correlation, plus the mean absolute error on relative
energies for scale.

This also avoids the category error M12 made (comparing standard deviations
across two scorers on different scales).

## THE ARTIFACT HYPOTHESIS, before running

* **If xtb is a usable ranker** -- Spearman well above 0 (say > 0.7), so the
  conformers it promotes are the ones DFT would have promoted.
* **If it is not** -- Spearman near 0, meaning tier 3 is filtering on noise and
  the funnel would do as well picking at random. That is a real possibility:
  M14 already showed one cheap scorer (Vina) that is smooth and uncorrelated.

A third outcome is live: STRONG correlation on big gaps and none on small ones,
which would say tier 3 is a coarse gate and not a ranker. The per-pair table
below is printed so that is visible rather than averaged away.

## Scope

One molecule, one conformer set, one basis. This characterises whether the
tiers AGREE, not whether either is right -- neither is validated against
experiment here, and this probe does not change that.
