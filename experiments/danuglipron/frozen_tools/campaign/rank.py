"""Arm D: rank candidates over (liability, fit loss, strain) — and gate the metric.

## The gate comes first

`fit_discriminates_controls` is not a diagnostic, it is a **precondition**. The
negative controls in `experiments.danuglipron.frozen_tools.morph.design` delete a pharmacophore contact while
barely changing molecular size (NC1: methyl ester, +14 Da; NC2: decyano, -43 Da).
The stated artifact hypothesis is:

- *if the fit metric works:* both controls score clearly worse than the parent;
- *if it is measuring size:* NC2 (smaller) scores BETTER than the parent, and the
  ranking of every real candidate is meaningless.

Those predictions differ, so the experiment is admissible — and if the gate
fails, the correct action is to report the metric as unusable, not to publish a
candidate ranking from it. Per CLAUDE.md: a negative result needs the same bar
as a positive one.

**OUTCOME (2026-08-29, updated after the n=100 run): the gate failed, and the
SECOND branch above turned out to be right — but only once charge was
controlled for.**

At n=40 the size hypothesis looked false (r(MW, fit) = +0.132) and NC2 was
merely unresolved. At n=100 both readings changed:

- NC2 resolves at 2σ and scores 18.5 kcal/mol BETTER than the parent. A
  pharmacophore-deleted inactive outranking the parent is a refutation, not a
  precision problem — and more sampling made it stronger.
- The metric is dominated by FORMAL CHARGE: −109.5 kcal/mol anion-vs-neutral
  against a 41.4 kcal/mol spread among the anions. That is why NC1 (the only
  neutral) separates so cleanly.
- Among the ten anions, with charge held constant, r(MW, fit) = **+0.490**. The
  earlier "+0.132, size ruled out" was measured on the mixed-charge set where
  the charge term swamped it.

So: it measures charge, then size. Recorded here because the pre-registered
hypotheses above are still in the docstring, and the next reader must act on
this outcome rather than on either prediction.

## Why a Pareto front and not a weighted score

Combining liability, fit and strain into one number requires exchange rates
between a structural-alert density, a kcal/mol interaction energy, and a
kcal/mol strain. No such exchange rate is defensible from anything measured
here, and inventing one would silently encode the conclusion. So the output is
the **non-dominated set**: candidates that no other candidate beats on every
axis simultaneously. That is a claim the data can support.
