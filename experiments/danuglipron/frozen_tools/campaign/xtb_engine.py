"""GFN2-xTB via the `xtb` command-line binary.

## Why a subprocess and not the `ferric-xtb` Rust binding

`crates/ferric-xtb` binds libxtb through its C ABI and is the right long-term
home, but it is (a) feature-gated OFF by default and (b) not exposed to Python
at all. More importantly, **libxtb is not thread-safe** — it carries
process-global state, and 3 of 8 tests fail under a parallel harness on values
that are exact when serialized (see the `xtb-gfortran-o3-miscompile` note).
Parallelism therefore has to be across PROCESSES, which is exactly what a
subprocess-per-conformer gives for free. Nothing here needs the FFI.

## The environment trap, encoded once

meson installs libxtb into the **multiarch** subdir
`~/.local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`, NOT `~/.local/lib`, so the `~/.local/lib`
convention used for libint2 elsewhere in ferric is not sufficient; `xtb` fails
with `libxtb.so.6: cannot open shared object file`. `XTBPATH` must also point at
the GFN parameter files. `_xtb_env()` below sets both.

## The correctness caveat that matters most

gfortran 13.3 **miscompiles** xtb 6.7.1's GFN1/GFN2 analytic gradient at `-O3`:
forces come out ~20x wrong while **energies stay byte-identical**. So a
single-point energy cannot detect a bad build — only a geometry optimization
can. `verify_xtb_build()` performs that discriminating check (a deliberately
distorted water must relax onto the GFN2 reference), and `relax()` refuses to
run until it has passed. This is not paranoia: the installed `~/.local` copy's
hash matches none of the known-good build artifacts, so the build provenance is
genuinely unknown and has to be established empirically.

    ## What this is for

    Conformer *generation* (ETKDG) samples free-solution torsional space. For a
    ligand with many rotatable bonds the bound conformer is one receptor-selected
    point in that space, and unbiased generation misses it -- measured on
    danuglipron (9 rotatable bonds): the best of 20 generated conformers was
    2.23 A from the bound pose against a 2.0 A success bar, and geometry
    OPTIMIZATION only improved that by 0.04-0.16 A because relaxation settles
    bonds and angles, not torsions.

    MD at elevated temperature crosses torsional barriers, so it *can* reach a
    different basin. Run with `point_charges` (the pocket field), the receptor
    biases which torsions are populated -- which is the whole point. Verified
    2026-08-29 that xtb applies the `pcharge` field during MD, not just to
    single points: water at frame 0 gives -5.046870 Ha in a test field vs
    -5.070374 Ha in vacuum, a 14.7 kcal/mol shift.

    ## Returns

    `(frames, run)` -- every dumped geometry, plus an `AnnealRun` record. Frames are
    RAW MD snapshots: hot, unrelaxed, and NOT energy-ordered. The caller is
    expected to relax and score them; scoring a raw frame directly compares
    a thermally excited geometry against a relaxed one.

    An empty frame list with `run.ok == False` means the MD did not run;
    `run.error` says why.

    ## Cost

    5 ps at 1 fs on a 70-atom molecule is 5000 GFN2 gradient calls -- tens of
    minutes. This is a *pose search*, priced accordingly; it is not a screening
    step.
