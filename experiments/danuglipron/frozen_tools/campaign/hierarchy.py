"""The cost hierarchy: which method does which job, and how a tier is retired.

## The principle

Every tier exists to DISCARD, cheaply, what the next tier cannot afford to
examine. A tier is chosen for its COST and its DISCRIMINATION, not for being
"the best method" — the best method applied to the wrong candidates is waste,
and a cheap method asked to make a fine distinction is noise.

    tier                cost/candidate  poses      job
    ------------------  --------------  ---------  -------------------------
    1  Vina (empirical) 26.4 s @ ex=4   10^5-10^6  SEARCH pose space
    2  MMFF / GFN-FF    2-22 ms         10^2-10^3  relax, drop clashes
    3  GFN2-xTB (DFTB)  0.05-0.15 s     10-10^2    rank survivors
    4  DFT + dispersion 0.7-9 s @ 9-19  1-10       final energetics
                        atoms; 612 s @ 71

MEASURED 2026-09-19 through the tier functions themselves (9-34 atoms,
STO-3G for tier 4), except tier 1 which is RESULTS.md M11. The figures
this table carried before -- `~10 us`, `~ms`, `~0.5 s`,
`minutes-hours` -- were never measured, and `tools/pipeline/tiers.py`
CITED THIS TABLE as their source while this table cited nothing. Tier 2
was 20x low; tier 3 was the right order; tier 1's `~10 us` is a per-POSE
figure that reads as per-candidate next to the others.

That is the same failure `TierOutcome.seconds` warns about below -- "a
cost split inferred from numbers nobody recorded" -- committed in this
module's own header. Costs here are now measurements or they say they
are not.

## Why this campaign needed it stated

The danuglipron campaign ran tier 3 alone, fed by free-solution conformers. It
had no tier 1, so it never searched; and no tier 4, so no number was ever better
than semiempirical. Four rounds of increasingly careful statistics were spent
characterising a metric fed geometries 2.2-4.1 A from the binding mode. See
`experiments/danuglipron/RESULTS.md` M3-M8.

Measured, once tier 1 was added: Vina reproduced the crystal pose at **0.95 A**
in ~2 minutes. The best any tier-3 method achieved in 62 minutes was 2.41 A.

## The division of labour is empirical, not assumed

Also measured on that run: r(vina_score, pose RMSD) = **+0.461**, and only 4 of
20 poses were under 2.0 A. So the cheap score is weakly informative about pose
quality — it FINDS the right pose but cannot reliably RANK it. That is the
justification for tiers 2-4 existing at all: if the tier-1 score could pick its
own best pose, no rescoring would be needed.

## Rules for using this, and for retiring a tier

1.  **VALIDATE EACH TIER AGAINST GROUND TRUTH BEFORE TRUSTING IT.** For pose
    generation that means redocking a known complex and measuring RMSD; the
    check costs minutes and is the difference between a pipeline and a
    guess. `experiments.danuglipron.frozen_tools.campaign.align.pose_quality_gate` is the gate.
2.  **A TIER'S OUTPUT IS ONLY AS GOOD AS ITS INPUT.** No amount of tier-4 rigour
    rescues a tier-1 failure. Diagnose DOWNWARD: when results look wrong, check
    the cheapest tier first, because that is where the population is set.
3.  **DO NOT ASK A TIER FOR A DISTINCTION FINER THAN ITS NOISE.** Quantify it:
    compare the candidate-to-candidate range against the standard error of the
    estimate (`rank.noise_exceeds_signal`), and never against a sample range,
    which grows with n.
4.  **A TIER IS RETIRED WHEN A CHEAPER ONE MATCHES IT, OR WHEN ITS JOB IS
    SOMEONE ELSE'S.** MD-as-pose-search was retired here not because it failed
    at an adequate timescale — it was never run at one — but because reaching
    that timescale (141 s/ps, ~26 h for the analogue set at 20 ps) means using a
    quantum method for a job an empirical search does in seconds.
5.  **KEEP EACH TIER'S FAILURE VISIBLE.** A tier that cannot answer returns
    None/UNEVALUATED, never a neutral-looking number. A fabricated zero in a
    liability score reads as "maximally safe"; a fabricated pose reads as a
    binding mode.
6.  **DO NOT BUY PRECISION BELOW A METHOD'S OWN ERROR BAR.** A tier's tuning
    knobs have the same noise floor its outputs do, so past some setting the
    extra cost buys nothing measurable. Measured (RESULTS.md M11): raising
    Vina's `exhaustiveness` from 4 to 32 cost **6.8x** and improved the top
    score by **0.005 kcal/mol** — against a scoring function whose published
    RMSE is ~2.5 kcal/mol, i.e. a gain ~500x smaller than its own error bar.
    Redock RMSD across an 8x range of effort moved 0.097 A against a 0.131 A
    between-seed SEM, so it was not resolvable either.

    The corollary is where the budget SHOULD go: to whichever input the answer
    is actually sensitive to. Here that was the starting conformer (0.75-1.24 A
    across ETKDG seeds), so three seeds at the cheap setting beat one seed at
    the expensive one — cheaper AND better sampled. Find the sensitive variable
    by measuring, then spend there.
7.  **TIME EVERY TIER.** "Which tier costs the run" decides where optimization
    effort goes, and it is routinely not what the cost table predicts: this
    campaign twice attributed a run's cost to the wrong tier from estimates
    alone. `TierOutcome.seconds` is None when unmeasured, never 0.0, because a
    zero reads as "free".
