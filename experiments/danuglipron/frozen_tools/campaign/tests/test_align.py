"""Tests for rigid-body alignment into the pocket frame.

The silent failure this file is built around: **an improper rotation**. A naive
SVD superposition can return a matrix with det = -1, which MIRRORS the molecule.
That inverts every stereocentre -- turning (S)-danuglipron into its (R) enantiomer
-- while producing an excellent-looking RMSD, because a mirror image fits an
achiral scaffold just as well. `test_kabsch_never_returns_a_reflection` and
`test_alignment_preserves_chirality` pin the guard from both ends.

The second theme: alignment must place the molecule IN the pocket. A conformer
176 A away scores as "no pocket charges nearby", so if alignment silently no-ops
the whole analogue arm produces no data. `test_alignment_moves_an_origin_centred_
conformer_into_the_pocket_frame` is the end-to-end check on real data.
