"""Cross-module unit-convention consistency.

`tools/campaign/fit.py` converts ligand Ångström coordinates to Bohr in order to
compare distances against pocket charges, which `tools/active_site` already
generated in Bohr. If those two conversions ever disagree, ligand and pocket end
up in different unit systems and every pose falls outside the field cutoff.

That failure is loud rather than silently wrong (the pose is reported
UNEVALUATED, not scored as zero — see `test_strain_and_fit.py`), but it is
confusing to debug from the symptom, so the constant is sourced from one place
and pinned here.
