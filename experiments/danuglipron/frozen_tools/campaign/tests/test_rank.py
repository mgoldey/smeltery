"""Tests for the ranking layer and, above all, for the metric gate.

The most valuable test in this file is `test_gate_fails_when_a_control_scores_as
_well_as_the_parent`: it proves the gate can FAIL. A gate that always passes is
arithmetic dressed up as a check (CLAUDE.md: "check the pass condition is
REACHABLE"), and this particular gate is what licenses every fit claim in the
campaign, so its ability to reject matters more than its ability to accept.

The second theme is the missing-data discipline. Every axis is Optional, and a
candidate with an unmeasured axis must neither dominate nor be dominated on it.
The failure mode being prevented: an analogue that failed to embed gets
`fit=None`, a `None`-as-0 coercion makes it look like a perfect binder, and it
tops the recommended front.
