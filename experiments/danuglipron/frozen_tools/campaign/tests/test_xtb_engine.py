"""Tests for the GFN2-xTB subprocess engine.

Two failure modes here are silent and would corrupt every downstream number, so
they get dedicated tests:

1.  **A miscompiled xtb.** gfortran 13.3 at `-O3` makes xtb 6.7.1's GFN1/GFN2
    analytic gradients ~20x wrong while leaving energies BYTE-IDENTICAL. A
    single-point comparison cannot detect it; only an optimization can. So
    `verify_xtb_build` is the gate, and `relax` must refuse to run without it.

2.  **Silently ignored point charges.** xtb takes external point charges from a
    bare `pcharge` file in the working directory. `xtb --help` documents no flag
    for this, and the obvious guess (`--input pcharge`) is xtb's DETAILED-INPUT
    flag with a totally different namelist format. If the file is not picked up,
    every "in field" energy silently equals its vacuum value -- a wrong answer
    with no error anywhere. `test_point_charges_actually_change_the_energy`
    pins that the field is really being applied.
