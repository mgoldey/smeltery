"""Tests for the strain (Arm A) and fit (Arms A/B) drivers.

Both quantities are DIFFERENCES, so the failure modes are reference-state
errors, and they are silent: you get a plausible number computed against the
wrong baseline. The tests here pin the reference discipline.

For fit, the headline invariant is that a pose with NO pocket charges nearby is
reported UNEVALUATED rather than scored as interaction 0.0 -- because 0.0 reads
as "electrostatically neutral", which for a ranking is a mid-table result rather
than the "we never measured this" that it actually means. Measured 2026-08-29:
18 of the 20 committed danuglipron conformers are ~176 A from the pocket, so
this path is the common case, not an edge case.
