"""Align a generated conformer into the pocket frame of a reference bound pose.

## Why this module has to exist

Measured 2026-08-29 on the committed danuglipron ensemble: only
`conf_00_cryo_em` lives in the 7LCJ pocket's coordinate frame (centroid
~(125.4, 157.0, 113.3) Å, closest pocket charge 1.99 Å, 353 charges within
10 Bohr). Every other conformer -- PubChem's and all 18 RDKit ones -- is
origin-centred, i.e. **176-179 Å away from the pocket**. A freshly embedded
analogue is likewise at the origin.

So any fit score computed on an unaligned conformer is meaningless. Without
this step the honest outcome is "no pocket charges within the cutoff"
(`experiments.danuglipron.frozen_tools.campaign.fit` reports exactly that, rather than an interaction of 0),
and the whole analogue arm would produce no data.

## What the alignment does, and its one real limitation

`align_to_reference` performs a least-squares rigid-body superposition
(Kabsch) of a common substructure onto the bound reference pose. For an
analogue, the common substructure is found by **maximum common substructure
(MCS)** against the parent, so the shared scaffold -- benzimidazole core,
piperidine linker, distal aryl -- is what gets overlaid, and the modified
region is placed by whatever the scaffold dictates.

**This is a rigid overlay, not docking.** It answers "if this analogue keeps the
parent's scaffold placement, what does its electrostatic environment look like?"
It does NOT search for the analogue's own best pose. A modification that would
genuinely rebind in a different orientation is therefore scored pessimistically,
and that limitation is a property of the measurement, not a bug -- it is stated
in `AlignedPose.method` so it travels with every number derived from it.

The alternative (full redocking per analogue) needs a docking engine this repo
does not have and would introduce a second, larger source of error. A rigid
scaffold overlay is the honest cheap answer, and it is the right one for a set
of analogues designed specifically to preserve that scaffold.
