"""Arms A/B: active-site fit — pocket electrostatic complementarity of a pose.

## What this measures, stated narrowly on purpose

`pocket_interaction_kcal` is the interaction of the ligand's electron density
with the pocket's fixed classical point-charge field:

    E_int = E(ligand, in pocket field) - E(ligand, vacuum)     [same geometry]

It is **one term of a binding free energy** — the electrostatic/polarization
term. It is NOT a binding affinity and NOT a potency prediction. Missing:
desolvation of both partners, the pocket's own reorganization, dispersion beyond
what the Hamiltonian carries, entropy, and any protein flexibility. A ranking on
this number is a ranking on electrostatic complementarity alone.

That narrowness is the point. Electrostatic complementarity is the term the
danuglipron pharmacophore is built around — the carboxylate anchor and the
electron-poor aryl near Trp33 — so it is the term most likely to discriminate a
modification that keeps those contacts from one that breaks them. And it is
cheap enough to run over a whole analogue set.

## Why the negative controls matter more than the candidates

The stated artifact hypothesis (`experiments/danuglipron/PLAN.md`): if this metric
works, `NC1-methyl-ester` (acid anchor deleted) and `NC2-decyano` (Trp33
terminus deleted) must score CLEARLY WORSE than the parent. `rank.
fit_discriminates_controls` performs that check, and it is a gate on the whole
campaign, not a diagnostic: a metric that cannot separate a known-inactive
control licenses no candidate ranking.

WHAT THE CONTROLS ACTUALLY FOUND (measured 2026-08-29, and it is a mixed
verdict worth knowing before reusing this module):

- **NC1 is discriminated decisively**: +103.7 kcal/mol worse than the parent
  (n=100). But see below -- NC1 is the only NEUTRAL species in the set, so this
  separation is charge detection, not pharmacophore recognition.
- **NC2 scores significantly BETTER than the parent**: -18.5 kcal/mol against a
  13.5 kcal/mol 2-sigma bar at n=100. A pharmacophore-deleted inactive
  outranking the parent REFUTES the metric.

At n=40 NC2 was merely unresolved (gap 17.8, bar 22.0) and this docstring said
the metric "cannot resolve" it. That was a precision statement and it is now
retracted: raising to n=100 dropped the SEM as 1/sqrt(n) exactly as predicted
(sd flat at ~46, SEM 7.6 -> 4.9) and the pair resolved -- on the WRONG SIDE.
More sampling made the refutation stronger, not weaker.

WHAT THE METRIC ACTUALLY MEASURES (2026-08-29, n=100):

  anion (q=-1) vs neutral (q=0)        -109.5 kcal/mol
  full spread among the 10 anions        41.4 kcal/mol
  r(MW, fit) among anions only            +0.490

It is dominated by formal charge. And note the correction to an earlier claim in
this file: "size is ruled out (r = +0.132)" was measured on the MIXED-charge set,
where a ~110 kcal/mol charge term swamped everything else. Controlling for charge
reverses it -- among the ten anions the size correlation is +0.490. Both numbers
are right about their own set; the mixed-charge one is the misleading one.

So this metric is REFUTED for ranking these analogues, not merely imprecise, and
the fix is not more poses. See experiments/danuglipron/RESULTS.md M5.

## Reference-state discipline

Vacuum and in-field energies must be at the SAME geometry, or the difference
picks up a relaxation energy as well. `pose_fit` enforces that by construction:
it computes both from one coordinate array.
