"""Arm A: conformer strain — what the bound pose costs relative to free solution.

## The quantity and why it is a toxicity lever

E_strain(pose) = E(pose geometry, relaxed in the pocket field)
               - E(global free minimum, relaxed in vacuum)

A ligand that must adopt a high-energy conformation to bind pays that strain out
of its binding free energy. The potency you observe is the intrinsic
complementarity MINUS the strain penalty, so a strained binder needs more
*concentration* for the same receptor occupancy — i.e. a higher dose, i.e. more
systemic exposure. For danuglipron the dose-limiting toxicity was
dose-dependent GI intolerability, so **strain is a toxicity lever that does not
require changing the molecule at all**: a modification that preserves the
contacts but relieves strain lowers the efficacious dose.

## Reference-state discipline

Strain is a DIFFERENCE, so its value is entirely determined by what you subtract.
Two traps, both of which produce a plausible-looking number:

1.  **Comparing different relaxation levels.** A bound pose relaxed in-field
    against a free minimum that was only MMFF-optimized mixes two energy
    functions; the "strain" is then mostly the GFN2-vs-MMFF offset. Everything
    here is GFN2 on both sides, and `StrainResult.method` records it.
2.  **Using a local free minimum as "the" free minimum.** The reference must be
    the LOWEST free-solution conformer found, not whichever one happened to be
    conformer 0. `free_reference` scans the whole ensemble and reports how many
    conformers it considered, so a single-conformer "reference" is visible as
    such.

Strain is reported in kcal/mol because that is the scale of the effect (a few
kcal/mol matters) and Hartree hides it.
