"""What the liability score CAN and CANNOT separate.

The golden path's answer table now claims toxicology "discriminates between
MOTIFS, not between substituents that leave the motif alone". Both halves are
load-bearing -- the first is why the gate is worth running, the second bounds
what its output may be read for -- so both are pinned here.

MEASURED 2026-09-19. The numbers are a rank-only liability density, not a
probability of toxicity; every endpoint's own note says so.
