"""Thin adapters presenting each existing tier with one uniform signature.

Deliberately thin: the chemistry lives in `tools/docking`, `tools/morph` and
`tools/campaign` and is NOT reimplemented here. This module exists so the funnel
can call four very different methods -- an empirical docking score, a force
field, a semiempirical Hamiltonian and a DFT SCF -- without knowing anything
about any of them.

                           each correct; the leading one is simply not the
                           default. Budget def2-svp unless you set the basis.

                           RHF/STO-3G sweep at 2.58, and the 32->71 pair),
                           all agreeing on 2.3-2.6. The old N^3-N^4 was the
                           textbook basis-function scaling, which is not
                           what varies when a MOLECULE grows at fixed basis.

                           next to the SCF. Its analytic GRADIENT is the same
                           order, so dispersion-corrected OPTIMIZATION costs
                           no more than uncorrected.

TIERS 3 AND 4 COST TWICE THE ROWS ABOVE under `context["score"] =
"interaction"`: the rows are ONE single point, and the interaction score is
E(in field) - E(vacuum), two single points at the same geometry. That is the
score substitution analogues need (a total energy cannot rank differing
formulas; `run_funnel` refuses the cut), so budget 2x for any analogue
campaign. The default `"total"` remains one single point.

Tier 4's cost is the reason the funnel must narrow to a handful before reaching
it. See `tools/campaign/hierarchy.py` for the rules.

    Measured 96.1 s at 32 atoms (def2-SVP/PBE; re-measured 99.0 s on
    2026-09-02), so this must only ever see the handful the tiers above left.

    Cost here is driven by ATOM COUNT, not basis size: ferric's KS grid is
    75x110 per atom, so a smaller basis does NOT make a big molecule cheap.
    See `tools/pipeline/cost.py`.

    **Dispersion.** This tier is labelled "DFT + dispersion" in
    `tools/campaign/hierarchy.py`, and as of the `ferric-d3` crate that label is
    true: `dispersion="d3bj"` is the DEFAULT here, adding Grimme's D3(BJ)
    two-body correction to the SCF energy. Dispersion is the dominant attractive
    term in ligand binding, so a bare semilocal DFT energy is not comparable
    between conformers or substituents.

    **What `value` is** follows `context["score"]`, exactly as in `tier3_gfn2`:
    the DFT total (`"total"`, the default, `formula_bound=True`) or the
    in-pocket minus vacuum interaction energy at one geometry
    (`"interaction"`, two SCFs, comparable across formulas). The payload
    carries `e_total` (in field) and `e_vacuum` (`None` unless computed).

    Pass `context["dispersion"] = None` to get the uncorrected SCF energy back.
    The result's payload carries `e_scf` and `e_dispersion` separately;
    `e_dispersion is None` means UNEVALUATED, never "zero dispersion".

    Two scope limits that this does NOT fix:
      - The Axilrod-Teller-Muto three-body term is not implemented (measured at
        0.1% of the two-body energy for benzene, and RISING with system size --
        see `ferric-d3`'s crate docs).
      - QM/MM dispersion is NOT covered. D3 is a QM-atom-pairwise correction, so
        dispersion between the QM region and MM point charges is still absent;
        that needs Lennard-Jones terms across the boundary, not this.

    `mem_budget_gb` is forwarded to `FERRIC_MEM_BUDGET_GB` because ferric's
    default is `0.8 x` *live* MemAvailable. That makes the internal
    Full-vs-Batched AO-cache decision depend on whatever else happens to be
    running on the box -- the same candidate can take the fast path or the
    batching path between two runs of the SAME pipeline. Pinning it keeps the
    tier reproducible; leaving it None preserves ferric's auto-detect.
