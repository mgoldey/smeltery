"""#323: the funnel must not rank a TOTAL energy across differing formulas.

A total energy tracks electron count, so a chloro analogue "beats" its fluoro
sibling by ~8 electrons' worth of Hartree whatever it does in the pocket. The
funnel was built for isomers (same formula, where totals compare) and was then
fed substitution analogues (`pipeline.substitution`), where they do not.

Anchors:
* same-formula populations cut EXACTLY as before (`formula_bound` changes
  nothing for isomers);
* a stage that keeps everyone makes no ranking decision and is allowed;
* `paired_delta` of a candidate against itself is exactly 0.
