"""The pose the docking tier picked must be the pose tiers 3 and 4 score.

`funnel._harvest_geometry` carries each stage's geometry into
`context["geometry"]`, which `tiers._embedded` reads. The production funnel
(experiments/danuglipron/run_isomer_pipeline.py) is

    dock -> mmff (tier2_forcefield) -> gfn2 -> dft

and `tier2_forcefield` re-embeds from SMILES in free solution and returns THAT
geometry in its payload. If harvesting lets a later stage replace an earlier
one, tier 2 silently swaps the docked pose for a conformer that never saw the
receptor -- the defect `_harvest_geometry` was written to close, reopened by
the stage that sits between the producer and the consumers.

`test_funnel.py::test_a_produced_geometry_reaches_the_next_tier` covers the
adjacent case (dock -> consumer). This file covers the production ladder.

Salvaged from the unmerged fix/funnel-pose-handoff branch (its D1 tests),
rewritten against main's harvest-into-context design.
