"""The pocket field reaches BOTH quantum tiers, in Bohr, and is applied.

`context["point_charges"]` is forwarded unchanged to two engines:

    tier3_gfn2 -> xtb_engine.singlepoint -> xtb's `pcharge` file
    tier4_dft  -> ferric.run_dft(point_charges=...)

Both must read the coordinates as BOHR, which is what
`experiments.danuglipron.frozen_tools.active_site.pocket_charges` produces. A unit slip here does not crash:
the engine converges, a ranking comes out, and every candidate is wrong by the
same factor -- a deterministic artifact that reproduces perfectly and so looks
like physics.

The unit is pinned against an INDEPENDENT construction, Coulomb's law, rather
than against the code under test. NH4+ (charge +1) with a +1 point charge
20 Bohr from the nitrogen: the leading interaction is q1 q2 / R = 1/20 Ha, and
polarisation is O(R^-3) or smaller.

MEASURED 2026-10-05 (xtb 6.x, GFN2, `pcharge` file), dE versus 1/R in Bohr and
in Angstrom:

    R    dE (xtb)   1/R_bohr   1/R_angstrom
    10   0.096579   0.100000   0.052918
    20   0.049574   0.050000   0.026459
    40   0.024943   0.025000   0.013229

So xtb reads BOHR -- the residual against 1/R_bohr is 4.3e-4 Ha at R=20 and
falls ~8x per doubling, as a polarisation tail should. An unsalvaged branch
(fix/funnel-pose-handoff) asserted the opposite (Angstrom) and converted at
tier 3; this test would reject that conversion, which puts the charge at
10.6 Bohr and gives dE ~ 0.094 Ha.
