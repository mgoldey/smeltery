"""Substituent scans: replace a matched site with each of a set of groups.

A SUBSTITUTIONAL isomer decorates a fixed scaffold. `structural.py` handles the
case where the scaffold itself changes.

Verified 2026-08-30 that RDKit's `RunReactants` plus canonical-SMILES dedup
collapses symmetry-equivalent products correctly: a fluorine scan of benzoic
acid gives exactly 3 products (ortho/meta/para) from 5 aryl hydrogens. Without
the dedup it would give 5, silently triple-counting the two mirror pairs and
inflating every downstream population count.
