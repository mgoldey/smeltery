    """The ranking limit belongs at the CALL SITE, not only in a doc.

    `compute_binding_energy` is what a user calls to ask "which analogue binds
    better". MEASURED (RESULTS.md M4-M14), five protocols for getting a ddE out
    of a pose ensemble were tried and all five closed -- the best available
    noise is 4.07 kcal/mol against substituent effects of 1-2.

    A reader who finds this function from an IDE never sees the golden-path
    note. The limit has to travel with the function, and this asserts it still
    does: a docstring is exactly the kind of thing a later edit trims.

    Checks for the MEASURED FIGURE and the explicit prohibition, not for prose
    style -- a rewrite that keeps both is fine, one that drops the number is
    not.
