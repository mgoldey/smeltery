def test_an_eleven_field_pqr_is_refused_not_misparsed(tmp_path):
    """A chain-ID PQR must ERROR, and the error must name the field count.

    `parse_pqr` requires exactly 10 whitespace fields and reads coordinates at
    `fields[5:9]`. A PQR carrying a chain ID has ELEVEN and shifts them to
    `fields[6:10]`, so parsing it positionally would read the RESIDUE NUMBER as
    x and silently place every charge somewhere else. That is the failure this
    pins against -- a clean refusal is correct here, a best-effort parse is not.

    WHY IT IS ONLY A REFUSAL AND NOT A FEATURE. MEASURED 2026-09-19: `pdb2pqr30`
    DROPS the chain ID. Fed a PDB whose ATOM records carry chain A, all 16
    output records came back 10-field. So the 11-field layout is not reachable
    through `derive_pocket_charges`, which is this repo's only producer, and
    adding support for it would be speculative. It IS reachable from a PQR
    written by another tool, and then the user gets an error that names the
    problem rather than coordinates off by one column.

    If someone later adds 11-field support, this test should be REPLACED by one
    asserting the coordinates land correctly -- not deleted.
