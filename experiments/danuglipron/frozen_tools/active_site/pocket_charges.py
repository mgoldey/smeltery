    Call this once per pocket, then reuse the result across many ligand

    Unlike `pocket_point_charges`, this also runs PDB2PQR through
    `parse_pqr_atoms` to populate `residue_ids`/`atom_names`/`res_names` —
    ready to feed straight into `QmSelection::WithinRadiusWholeResidues`.

    PQR (as PDB2PQR emits it) has no chain column, and `res_seq` restarts
    per chain — so residue ids are assigned **by contiguous run of
    `(res_name, res_seq)`**, never by `res_seq` (or `(res_name, res_seq)`)
    value alone: a new residue id starts the instant this atom's
    `(res_name, res_seq)` differs from the file's immediately preceding
    atom, for any reason (a genuinely new residue, a `res_seq` decrease —
    PDB2PQR's chain-break signal — or the SAME `(res_name, res_seq)` pair
    recurring later once other residues have intervened, e.g. chain B
    restarting at residue 1 with the same residue names as chain A).
    Because ids only ever increment forward as the file is walked, a pair
    seen earlier is NEVER merged back into its old run: chain A's residue
    12 and chain B's residue 12 always get distinct ids, even though both
    carry the same raw `res_seq`.
