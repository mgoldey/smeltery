"""Ligand-in-pocket electrostatic binding energy: field-vs-vacuum QM.

E_int = E(ligand, QM, embedded in the pocket's classical point-charge field)
      - E(ligand, QM, vacuum)

The pocket is always classical point charges (via PDB2PQR); only the ligand
is ever a QM `Molecule`. This sidesteps BSSE/counterpoise entirely since
there is no QM-QM supermolecular interaction energy being computed.

This is a thin orchestration over four composable, independently reusable
stages — read it as a worked example for building your own variant (e.g.
cache `PocketCharges` across many ligands/conformers, skip `compute_charges`
for speed, or swap `use_field`/`method` per call):

    pocket    = derive_pocket_charges(pocket_pdb)      # once per pocket
    embedded  = embed_ligand(ligand_xyz, pocket)        # once per ligand geometry
    e_vacuum  = compute_energy(embedded, use_field=False)
    e_field   = compute_energy(embedded, use_field=True)
    charges   = compute_charges(embedded, e_field)

    WHAT THIS NUMBER CANNOT DO: RANK ANALOGUES.

    The value is well defined and reproducible FOR ONE POSE. It is the pose
    that is the problem. MEASURED on the danuglipron campaign
    (`experiments/danuglipron/RESULTS.md`, M4-M14), five protocols for getting
    a ddE out of a pose ensemble were tried and all five closed:

        average over n poses    SEM*sqrt(2) = 4.07 kcal/mol   16x the gap
        select one pose (M13)   sd*sqrt(2)  = 40.66           163x
        a real pose search      1% improvement, 32.5x short
        a different scorer      none available is less pose-sensitive
        a better tier           the error is in the ENSEMBLE, not the SCF

    Substituent effects are 1-2 kcal/mol, so the BEST available ddE noise is
    ~2-4x the signal. No amount of tier-4 DFT fixes this: it is pose variance,
    not electronic-structure error, and averaging more poses only buys
    sqrt(n).

    So: quote this for ONE ligand in ONE pose, or as a component of a larger
    model. Do not order two analogues by it. `site_substituent_heatmap` takes
    a `noise_floor=` for exactly this reason -- pass 4.07 (or your own measured
    figure) and it greys out every cell the data cannot separate.
