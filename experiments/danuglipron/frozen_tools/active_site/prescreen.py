"""Cheap classical electrostatic pre-screen for ligand poses, ahead of QM.

Wraps `pocket_field.pocket_field_at_atoms` around an already-`embed_ligand`'d
pose: no SCF, just Coulomb's law over the pose's own (overlap-filtered)
`point_charges` evaluated at the ligand's own atom positions. Useful for
ranking/filtering many candidate poses (docking output, conformer ensembles)
down to the handful worth spending real QM time on via
`binding_energy.compute_binding_energy` — the classical field a pocket
exerts at a badly-clashing or poorly-oriented pose's atoms is usually already
a strong, nearly-free signal before any electronic response is computed.

`batch_prescreen` is the entry point for a real screening run: derive the
pocket's charges ONCE (`pocket_charges.derive_pocket_charges`), then rank an
entire conformer/pose ensemble against it in one call. Typical shape of a
real workflow:

    pocket = derive_pocket_charges(pocket_pdb)
    ranked = batch_prescreen(pocket, ligand_xyz_paths, charge_source=my_charges)
    top_5 = [r for r in ranked if r.error is None][:5]
    for r in top_5:
        result = compute_binding_energy(r.ligand_xyz, pocket_pdb, ...)  # real QM
