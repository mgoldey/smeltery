"""Does every DESIGNED danuglipron analogue actually produce 3D geometry?

Campaign-specific counterpart to `tools/morph/tests/test_embed.py`, which tests
the generic embedder. This one asserts that this particular hypothesis set is
embeddable -- if an arm fails to embed, that arm silently has no data.

NOTE (RESULTS.md M7): embedding SUCCEEDING is necessary but far from sufficient.
Every conformer generated here misses the experimentally determined bound pose by
2.2-4.1 A, against a 2.0 A docking-success bar, so these geometries are usable
for strain but NOT for pocket fit. See `experiments.danuglipron.frozen_tools.campaign.align.pose_quality_gate`.
