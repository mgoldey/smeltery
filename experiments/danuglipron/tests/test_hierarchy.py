"""The cost hierarchy must stay ordered, and unvalidated tiers must stay visible.

This file exists because the campaign's central failure was a HIERARCHY failure,
not a physics one: tier 3 was run alone, fed by free-solution conformers, with
no tier 1 to search and no tier 4 to make a final number. Four rounds of
statistics were spent on geometries 2.2-4.1 A from the binding mode.

What is worth pinning is therefore structural, not numeric:
  - the tiers stay ordered by cost (a hierarchy that is not cost-ordered is
    just a list of methods);
  - a tier with no ground-truth validation is REPORTED as unvalidated rather
    than silently trusted.
