"""Tests for the analogue design set and its pharmacophore constraint.

THE ANCHOR THIS FILE ENFORCES (CLAUDE.md, Experimental Protocol): every
approximation has a trivial limit where it does nothing. Here that limit is a
"zero-modification analogue" -- an `Analogue` whose SMILES *is* the parent. It
must be indistinguishable from the parent on every axis the campaign measures.
`test_zero_modification_analogue_is_identical_to_parent` is that assert, and it
catches the entire class of analogue-plumbing error (label/SMILES mismatch, a
transform applied to the wrong record, a descriptor computed on a stale mol)
before any ranking is produced.

THE SECOND THING WORTH TESTING is that the pharmacophore check can actually
FAIL. A constraint that passes for everything is not a constraint; it is
decoration. The negative controls exist for exactly this reason, and
`test_negative_controls_break_exactly_their_intended_feature` pins that they
break the feature they claim to and no other -- otherwise a control that broke
three features would not isolate anything.
