"""M7: does a real pose SEARCH reduce the per-pose scatter that M5/M6 closed?

## Why this probe exists

RESULTS.md M4-M6 measured, on danuglipron against the GLP-1R pocket:

  | route                       | status |
  |-----------------------------|--------|
  | more poses (M4/M5)          | CLOSED -- sd is flat in n; the metric is refuted |
  | relax poses in field (M6)   | CLOSED -- real 15% sd reduction, ~3 orders short |
  | real pose search (docking)  | UNTESTED -- "no docking engine available in this repo" |

That last line is STALE. `tools/docking/vina_dock.py` now wraps AutoDock Vina
(1.2.7) with meeko (0.8.0), both importable in this environment. So the one
route M6 left open is now testable, and this probe tests it.

## The question, stated as a number

M6's parent numbers: rigid overlay sd = 34.23 kcal/mol, relaxed-in-field
sd = 29.07. The gap a candidate RANKING must resolve is 0.25 kcal/mol
(parent vs H1b at n=100), which needs

    n >= 4 * 2 * sd^2 / gap^2

At sd = 29.07 that is ~108,000 poses per candidate. For docking to rescue the
ranking at a plausible n = 100, the required sd is

    sd <= gap * sqrt(n / 8) = 0.25 * sqrt(12.5) = 0.88 kcal/mol

i.e. a **33x** reduction from 29.07. That is the bar, and it is stated here
BEFORE running so the result cannot be graded against a bar chosen afterwards.

## THE ARTIFACT HYPOTHESIS, written before measuring

Per the repo's experimental protocol, the two outcomes must be distinguishable
in advance:

* **If docking genuinely reduces the scatter** -- poses land in one binding
  mode, energies tighten, AND the poses stay geometrically distinct enough that
  the ensemble is still an ensemble. Expect sd down, mean pairwise RMSD down
  but NOT collapsed (M6 saw 3.98 -> 3.84 A, a 4% move, and called that real).

* **If it is an artifact** -- sd falls because every pose collapses onto ONE
  geometry. Then the "ensemble" has n=1 of information, the sd is measuring
  numerical noise rather than pose diversity, and averaging it is meaningless.
  Signature: mean pairwise RMSD collapsing toward ~0.

These predict DIFFERENT things (RMSD stays vs RMSD collapses), so the
experiment can distinguish them. That check is `geometric_spread_angstrom`
below, and it is reported whether or not the sd moves.

A third outcome is live and is NOT a failure of the probe: docking reduces sd
substantially but not by 33x. That closes the route with a number, the same way
M6 closed relaxation with "15%".

## THE COMPARISON MUST USE THE SAME INSTRUMENT

First version of this probe reported Vina's own `vina_score` sd (0.83
kcal/mol) against M6's 29.07 and computed a "35x reduction" that cleared the
bar. **That was a category error and the number is void.** `vina_score` is
documented in `tools/docking/vina_dock.py` as "empirical -- a ranking
heuristic only", on a ~-11 kcal/mol scale; M6's -159.98 is an xtb interaction
energy via `experiments.danuglipron.frozen_tools.campaign.fit.pose_fit`. Two different quantities on two
different scales have incomparable standard deviations, and the tidiness of
the result (0.83 landing just under an 0.88 bar) was the tell.

So this probe DOCKS with Vina and then RESCORES every pose with the SAME
`pose_fit` M6 used. The sd that is compared is the pose_fit sd. Vina's own
score is still reported, clearly labelled, because the spread of the search
heuristic is interesting -- it is just not the measurement.

## What this does NOT do

It scores ONE candidate (the parent) to characterise the scatter. It does not
rank candidates -- that is the thing the scatter currently forbids. It also
does not re-litigate M5: n is held at the M6 comparison point, because the
question is whether the SD moved, not whether the SEM can be driven down.
