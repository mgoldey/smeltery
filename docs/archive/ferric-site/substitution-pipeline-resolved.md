# How we make a pipeline for proposing viable active-site substitutions

**2026-09-19.** The pipeline's STAGES are settled and every one of them exists
in code. What is NOT settled is that its ranking can be trusted at the
1-2 kcal/mol resolution a substitution campaign needs. All four pose protocols
have been measured and all four fail.

Everything here is MEASURED on danuglipron against the GLP-1R pocket (7LCJ)
unless labelled otherwise. Sources: `experiments/danuglipron/RESULTS.md`
(M4-M13), `wiki/golden-path-pipeline-2026-09-18.md`.

## Average over poses; do not select one

**Do not "pick the top-docked pose".** It is measurably worse than averaging,
and the reason generalises: nothing in this sample shows Vina's ranking axis
tracks the xtb scoring axis, so selecting on it behaves like a random draw.

The pipeline's STAGES are unaffected -- P1-P7 stand -- but what the output may
be used for is not.

Selecting the top-docked pose is **10x worse** than averaging. Vina's ranking
showed no detectable monotonic relation to the xtb score on these 15 poses
(Spearman -0.261, p=0.35 -- a NON-SIGNIFICANT test, which fails to demonstrate
a correlation rather than proving there is none; n=15 can only detect
|rho| >= ~0.51). With no usable ranking signal, "pick rank 0" behaves as a
single draw from a distribution with sd 28.75 kcal/mol. Averaging at n=100 gives ddE noise 4.07;
selecting gives 40.66. Both miss the 0.25 kcal/mol gap, by 16x and 163x.

I had justified selection with "M9 redocks to 0.95 A". M9 says two paragraphs
under its own headline that it did so **"partly by luck"** (r = +0.461, only
4/20 poses under 2.0 A). I quoted the headline and not the caveat beneath it.

**What this means for the pipeline:** the stages below are right, and the
ranking they produce is NOT trustworthy at 1-2 kcal/mol resolution by any pose
protocol currently available. Use it to answer *"does this analogue bind in
this site at all"*, not *"which of these two is better"*. See
"What the pipeline may and may not claim" at the end.

## The decision that WAS thought to be blocking: select vs average (SUPERSEDED)

Per-pose energy scatter is **sd ~29 kcal/mol** against substituent effects of
**1-2 kcal/mol**. Three routes to averaging that away have now been tried, and
all three are closed with numbers:

| route | result | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| more poses (M4/M5) | sd flat in n; SEM falls as 1/sqrt(n) but sd does not move | closed -- resolving a 0.25 kcal/mol gap needs ~7350 poses |
| relax poses in field (M6) | 34.23 -> 29.07, a real 15% tightening, poses stay distinct | closed -- ~3 orders of magnitude short |
| real pose search (M12) | 29.07 -> 28.75, **1%**, poses MORE diverse (RMSD 3.84 -> 5.81 A) | closed -- 32.5x short |

So the answer is not a better ensemble. It is also **not** selection -- M13
measured that and it is worse (see the retraction above). A fourth row belongs
in that table:

| select one pose (M13) | ddE noise 40.66 vs averaging's 4.07 | closed -- 10x WORSE |

### A fifth row, and it is a different KIND of row (M17, 2026-09-19)

Every route above attacks the per-pose **sd** and accepts the **estimator**.
All of them compute `ddE` over INDEPENDENTLY embedded ensembles, which is an
UNPAIRED design over noise that is largely COMMON to the two molecules: the
scatter is pose-conformational, a property of the scaffold in the pocket, while
a substitution changes a handful of atoms and leaves ~68 where they were.

| pair poses by scaffold (M17) | paired SEM **0.221-0.615**, vs **0.459-0.742 unpaired ON THE SAME 24 POSES** | **PROVISIONAL -- gas-phase MMFF only** |

**The comparison in that row is same-data, and that matters.** The 4.07 above is
the n=100 UNPAIRED SEM from a different experiment; quoting `4.07 -> 0.221` as
the effect of pairing would credit pairing with the difference between two
experiments. `paired_ddE` computes both estimators from the SAME 24 poses, and
the honest isolated gain is **1.21x (Cl) to 2.42x (F) on the SEM** -- with the self-anchor
and N-methyl far higher because their noise is almost entirely common. What
crosses the 1-2 kcal/mol line is the ABSOLUTE paired SEM, which is a
cross-experiment comparison and is labelled as one.

`var(ddE_paired) = sd_A^2 + sd_B^2 - 2*rho*sd_A*sd_B`, which is the familiar
`2*sd^2*(1-rho)` only when the two spreads are EQUAL (they are here, to a few
percent). So the win is essentially all in `rho`, and `rho` is what a pocket
could destroy -- when the spreads differ the scale terms move the variance too,
and the ratio stops being a function of `rho` alone. Note that a shared random SEED is not a pairing:
ETKDG with the same seed on two different graphs gives uncorrelated conformers.
The pairing must be geometric -- pose k of the analogue BUILT FROM pose k of the
parent.

Two results from that probe matter more than the SEM:

* **A hard scaffold pin FAILS its own exactness anchor by +13.8 kcal/mol** --
  it charges that much for pairing the parent with ITSELF, because the
  substituent is forced into whatever room the parent pose left. Relaxing the
  substituent against a restrained scaffold passes at +0.004.
* **The Cl row is the warning**: rho 0.399, SEM ratio only 1.21x (a
  standard-error ratio, not a variance one -- the variance figure is its
  square).
  Pairing helps where the substitution is LOCAL and degrades smoothly to the
  unpaired case where it is not -- so a paired floor is PER-CANDIDATE, never
  one campaign-wide number.

This does NOT reopen the ranking claim below. It is measured on one molecule,
one force field, gas phase, with no pocket, and the thing a pocket most plausibly
breaks is exactly the correlation the method depends on. It is a reason to run
that experiment. See RESULTS.md M17 and
`wiki/paired-ddE-substitution-2026-09-19.md`.

Pose GENERATION is nonetheless solved for this target: M9 redocks danuglipron
into 7LCJ at **0.95 A**, 20/20 poses within 5 A of the known site, where the
best of 20 RDKit conformers was 2.23 A. That licenses *"the near-native pose is
in the candidate set"*. It does not license *"the first one is it"* -- M9's own
r(vina_score, RMSD) = +0.461 says otherwise.

### The number that makes the decision concrete

On the SAME 15 docked geometries:

```
Vina's own score      sd =  0.83 kcal/mol
xtb (pose_fit)        sd = 28.75 kcal/mol
```

The cheap tier sees a nearly flat landscape where xtb sees one spanning
103 kcal/mol. This is M9's `r(vina_score, RMSD) = +0.461` viewed from the
energy side, and it is the empirical case for the whole hierarchy: **tier 1
generates the right answer among its candidates and cannot pick it out.** If it
could, tiers 2-4 would be decoration.

## The pipeline

```
P0  parent + site SMARTS + pocket PDB
P1  ENUMERATE      propose_substitutions          -> SMILES per (substituent, SITE)
P2  DESCRIPTOR     relative_descriptors           -> gate vs the PARENT, not absolutes
P3  EMBED          embed_proposals (ETKDG, seeded) -> symbols + coords
P4  DOCK           dock_ligand per analogue        -> pose ENSEMBLE (do NOT take rank 0)
P5  PRESCREEN      prescreen_pose (classical)      -> cheap triage, no SCF
P6  RANK           xtb pose_fit, MEAN over the ensemble -> ddE vs the parent
P7  CONFIRM        ferric DFT + D3(BJ)             -> survivors only
```

Steps P1-P3 and P5 exist and are tested (#96, #102). P4 exists
(`tools/docking/vina_dock.py`) and is validated by M9's redock. P6's engine
exists (`tools/campaign/xtb_engine.py`). P7 uses #99's D3(BJ) (merged), without
which a halogen/CF3 scan would miss its dominant attractive term.

### The four rules the pipeline must follow, each from a measurement

1. **ddE, never absolute.** The parent is carried through every stage for this
   reason. An absolute binding energy carries the full method error; the
   difference cancels most of it. Same argument as P2's relative gate.

2. **The unit is the (substituent, SITE) pair -- and NEITHER TIER CAN
   EXPRESS IT.** MEASURED within/between ratio **0.94-0.95** on two independent
   constructions: WHERE a group goes matters as much as WHICH group. But:

   - the CHEAP gate is **site-blind by construction** (M15). MW, cLogP and
     TPSA are whole-molecule sums, so 9 sites of one substituent give ONE
     descriptor tuple. Verified on ortho/meta/para fluorobenzoic acid: bit
     identical. No fix to `relative_descriptors` changes this.
   - the EXPENSIVE tier is **noise-limited** (M4-M14): ddE noise 4.07 kcal/mol
     against effects of 1-2.

   So the substituent axis is answerable and the site axis is not. Rank
   SUBSTITUENTS cheaply; treat placement as a question for chemistry knowledge
   or an experiment, not for this pipeline. Seeing a site would need a
   POSITIONAL descriptor (3-D shape, per-atom charge, a QM property at the
   site) -- an addition to cost, not a fix to apply.

3. **One row per molecule is the WRONG shape.** Averaging is the least-bad
   estimator (see above), so `funnel.py` needs to express a pose ENSEMBLE --
   and it keys one row per candidate (`funnel.py:162`). This is a real, open
   gap.

4. **Ionization state is part of the measurement.** Danuglipron's carboxylic
   acid is deprotonated at pH 7.4; the anion/neutral split is 143 kcal/mol
   (M-series). Net charge is an explicit input at every scoring stage, never
   defaulted to 0.

### Cost, from the measured hierarchy

| tier | method | s/pose | population | job |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | AutoDock Vina | 1e-5 | 1e5-1e6 | **search** pose space |
| 2 | MMFF94 | 1e-3 | 1e2-1e3 | relax, declash |
| 3 | GFN2-xTB | 5e-1 | 10-1e2 | rank survivors |
| 4 | ferric DFT + D3(BJ) | 6e+2 | 1-10 | final energetics |

Tier 4 runs end to end inside the funnel (`test_golden_path_smoke.py`, see
below), so its COMPOSITION is validated. No tier-4 number has been checked
against an external reference in this pipeline, so do not present tier-4
energies as validated binding energetics.

## What the pipeline may and may not claim

**May:** "this analogue docks into this site, and here is where." Pose
GENERATION is validated (M9: 0.95 A redock, 20/20 within 5 A). The enumeration,
the relative descriptor gate and the classical prescreen all work and are
tested.

**Not yet, but no longer ruled out (M17):** a per-candidate ddE at 1-2 kcal/mol,
via a PAIRED estimator rather than a quieter ensemble. Gas-phase MMFF gives SEM
0.221-0.615, against 0.459-0.742 unpaired on the SAME poses (the n=100 4.07 is
a different experiment). Untested in a pocket, which
is the test that decides it.

**May not, part 1:** "put this group at THIS position." The cheap gate cannot
see position at all (M15, inherent), and the expensive tier cannot resolve the
difference. Both halves of the stated unit are blocked, for different reasons.

**May not, part 2:** "analogue A binds better than analogue B by 1-2 kcal/mol."
No pose protocol available today supports that. The five measured options:

| protocol | ddE noise (kcal/mol) | vs the 0.25 gap |
|---|---|---|
| select one pose (M13) | 40.66 | 163x |
| average n = 100 (M5) | 4.07 | 16x |
| a different scorer (M14) | 4.68 (best tracking) | 19x |
| relax then average (M6) | ~4.1 | ~16x |
| dock then average (M12) | ~4.1 | ~16x |

Averaging is the least-bad option and is still 16x short. Reporting a ranking
from this would be reporting noise.

## What is still NOT settled

* ~~**The lever left is a scorer less sensitive to pose.**~~ **CLOSED by M14
  (2026-09-19).** Scored the SAME 19 docked poses with every scorer in the
  repo, comparing coefficient of variation (dimensionless, so comparable
  across scales):

  | scorer | CV | Spearman vs pose_fit |
  |---|---|---|
  | vina_score | 0.071 | -0.202 (p=0.41) |
  | pose_fit (xtb) | 0.315 | reference |
  | prescreen (classical) | 2.955 | +0.353 (p=0.14) |

  prescreen is **9.4x worse**. Vina looks 4.4x smoother and does not track
  pose_fit at all -- smooth because it is insensitive, not because it is
  better. **No scorer in this repo is less pose-sensitive**, so the remaining
  route is one that is pose-averaged BY CONSTRUCTION (FEP, or an ML affinity
  model trained on ensembles), which is outside this campaign.
* **`funnel.py` cannot express an ensemble** (`funnel.py:162`, one row per
  candidate). Whether that is worth fixing depends on the resolution you want,
  and the answer is measured (sd = 33.06 from M14's 19 docked poses):

  | poses averaged | ddE noise | vs the 0.25 kcal/mol gap |
  |---|---|---|
  | 1 | 46.75 | 187x |
  | 15 | 12.07 | 48x |
  | 100 | 4.68 | 19x |
  | 1000 | 1.48 | 6x |

  A 2-sigma resolution of 0.25 kcal/mol needs **~140,000 poses per candidate**.

  So ensemble support is NOT the blocker it was listed as for lead
  optimisation -- no reachable n gets there. It IS worth building if the
  question is coarse: separating a 15 kcal/mol control from the parent needs
  only a handful of poses, and that is the gate the campaign actually failed
  at n=1 (v1's selection-bias artifact). **Build it for gates, not for
  rankings**, and size n from this table rather than from intuition.
* ~~**Tier 4 unvalidated -- M10 recorded it does not fit.**~~ **STALE, and it
  cites a title M10 itself retracted on 2026-09-02.** Checked against the code
  2026-09-19:

  - **Cost**: RESOLVED. 612.4 s (10.2 min), 18 iterations, converged, for the
    71-atom neutral acid at STO-3G/PBE. The ">57 min, did not finish" was
    MEMORY CONTENTION -- a 7.26 GB auto-budget against a ~9.5 GB need, paging
    until the OOM killer fired -- not DFT cost.
  - **The 0-of-5 survivor failure**: both causes FIXED and verified present.
    (a) the driver declared `net_charge=-1` on NEUTRAL structures, which asks
    for an electron that does not exist; now deprotonates the STRUCTURE
    (`Isomer.deprotonated`, `tools/isomers/model.py:44`) with
    `test_deprotonation_conserves_electron_count` pinning it. (b) ring
    contractions that SEVER a ring produced fragment pairs; now rejected at
    enumeration (`enumerate.py:82`) and again at tier 1 (`tiers.py:125`).

  - **End to end since the fixes**: DONE 2026-09-19. The full FF -> xtb -> DFT
    stack now runs in `tools/pipeline/tests/test_golden_path_smoke.py`:

        FORCE_FIELD    3 -> 3   failed 0
        SEMIEMPIRICAL  3 -> 2   failed 0
        QUANTUM        2 -> 1   failed 0     <- used to be 0 out
        survivor: CC(=O)O  dft = -225.757 Ha

    ~1.7 s, so it belongs in the fast tier, and it is mutation-tested against
    the exact M10 failure mode (making tier 4 fail every candidate fails the
    test).

  So tier 4 is validated as far as COMPOSITION goes. What is genuinely left:
  no tier-4 number has been checked against
  an external reference IN THIS PIPELINE (ferric's DFT is separately validated
  against PySCF to ~2e-8 Ha, but that is the solver, not the funnel's use of
  it).
* **No ranking validated end to end.** VERIFIED 2026-09-19 that the repo
  contains no experimental affinity data at all (grepped `experiments/` and
  `testdata/` for IC50/Ki/Kd/pChEMBL: zero hits), so this is blocked on DATA
  ACQUISITION, not on analysis. No further measurement inside this campaign can
  move it, which is why the question "how do we make this pipeline" is answered
  and "is its ranking right" is not.

  What it would take: a congeneric series with measured relative affinities on
  this target, ~10+ compounds spanning >2 kcal/mol. Until then the pipeline's
  output is a HYPOTHESIS GENERATOR, and the measured noise floors above say how
  far to trust it.

## Honest status line
