# Pharma use-case coverage

Every named use case, what runs it, what it costs, and the plot that answers
it. Costs are MEASURED on this project; where a figure depends on basis or on
warm-vs-cold, both are given, because quoting one hides a 3-30x spread.

## Coverage

| score with DFT | `tiers.tier4_dft` | **2.6 s** @ 9 atoms at the def2-svp DEFAULT (0.75 s at STO-3G); one SCF, ×2 under `score="interaction"` | `tier_comparison` |

## Where the campaign time actually goes

The whole funnel RUN end to end — 10 substitution candidates of benzoic acid
through dock → FF → xtb → DFT against the 7LCJ pocket, keeping 6/4/2/1, zero
failures. These are COST measurements only. That run ranked the analogues on
total energies, which order differing formulas by electron count rather than by
binding, so its survivor carries no selection information. `run_funnel` refuses
that cut; the comparable score is `score="interaction"` (in-pocket minus vacuum
at one geometry), which runs two single points per candidate at the xtb and DFT
tiers and so doubles those columns:

| basis | total | dock | FF | xtb | DFT |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| STO-3G | 45.0 s | **72.7%** | 0.1% | 0.3% | 27.0% |
| **def2-svp (the `tier4_dft` DEFAULT)** | 82.1 s | **39.8%** | 0.1% | 0.1% | **60.0%** |

With the xtb and DFT columns doubled for `score="interaction"` (derived from the
rows above, not separately measured):

| basis | total | dock | FF | xtb | DFT |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| STO-3G | 57.2 s | **57.2%** | 0.1% | 0.5% | 42.3% |
| **def2-svp** | 131.3 s | 24.9% | 0.1% | 0.1% | **74.9%** |

**"Docking dominates, not DFT" holds only at STO-3G.** At the default basis the
ranking inverts and DFT is the majority of the run. The absolute docking cost
is identical between the rows (32.7 s); it is DFT that moves, because
`tier4_dft` defaults to def2-svp and that is 3.5x STO-3G.

So: quote the share WITH the basis, and decide where to optimize from the row
that matches the basis you actually run.

## What "has a plot" does and does not mean

The plot has to answer *that* use case's question. A transition-state search
produces an imaginary MODE — a 3N vector — so `imaginary_mode` shows whether it
displaces the reacting atoms, which is the second and non-optional half of
verifying a saddle. One imaginary frequency is necessary, not sufficient: a
methyl rotor gives one too.

**A plot and a cost do not license a RANKING.** The binding-energy row has
both and still cannot order two analogues: every pose protocol tried is closed
(RESULTS.md M4-M13), and the best available ddE noise is ~4.07 kcal/mol against
substituent effects of 1-2. `site_substituent_heatmap(noise_floor=...)` greys
out every cell inside that limit so a figure cannot imply otherwise.

## Known gaps

- **AMBER `prmtop`** — no reader; go through OpenMM.
- **Periodic boundary conditions** — absent. `solvate()` gives a finite
  droplet with a vacuum boundary.
- **QM/MM dispersion** — D3/D4/XDM/VV10 are QM-atom-pairwise, so dispersion
  between the QM region and MM charges is absent.
- **Pose-ensemble ranking** — see above; this is a noise floor, not a missing
  feature.
