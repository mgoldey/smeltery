"""Put a united-atom docked pose back on a full-hydrogen topology.

## Why this is its own module

PDBQT — what AutoDock Vina reads and writes — is **united-atom**: nonpolar
hydrogens are merged into the carbons they sit on. MEASURED on danuglipron
(ferric experiments/RESULTS.md M14): a docked pose has **42 atoms and 263 electrons** where the
real molecule has **71 and 292**.

That difference is not cosmetic, and the two consumers in ferric disagree
about it in the worst possible way:

* ferric's `embed_ligand_from_coords` **refuses** — 263 electrons at multiplicity 1
  implies `n_alpha = 263/2`, which is not an integer. A loud, immediate failure.
* ferric's `pose_fit` **accepts it silently**. xtb will happily run on a molecule missing
  29 hydrogens and return a number that looks entirely normal.

So the same pose is rejected by one scorer and quietly scored by the other. A
copy of this fix living inside one probe script is how that asymmetry persists;
it belongs where every pose consumer can reach it.

## What it does NOT fix

Restoring hydrogens does not make a docked pose a relaxed structure. The heavy
atoms are pinned exactly where docking put them — that is the point, since
moving them would score a different pose than the one that was docked — so any
strain in the docked heavy-atom frame is still there.

def parse_smiles_idx_remark(pdbqt_text: str) -> dict[int, int]:
    """Meeko's `REMARK SMILES IDX` mapping: PDBQT serial -> RDKit index (0-based).

    Returns `{}` when the remark is absent, which a caller must treat as
    "mapping unknown" rather than "identity".

    **The indices are into MEEKO'S OWN `REMARK SMILES`, not into yours.** Meeko
    rewrites the SMILES (canonically identical, atom order different), so a map
    built here is only meaningful against the molecule built from that string.
    MEASURED on danuglipron: our SMILES and meeko's are the same molecule by
    canonical form but their element sequences differ, and applying the map to
    OUR topology still yields the (R) enantiomer of an (S) drug. Pair this with
    `smiles_from_pdbqt_remark` and build from that.

    **Meeko REORDERS atoms.** MEASURED on aspirin: 10 of 13 heavy atoms come
    back at a different position than RDKit gave them, and assigning
    coordinates by list order misplaces an atom by up to **4.9 A**. That is a
    scrambled molecule scored as if it were the pose -- same atom COUNT, same
    elements, no error anywhere.

    Meeko writes the remark as pairs across one or more lines:

        REMARK SMILES IDX 5 1 6 2 7 3 8 4 9 5 10 6 4 7 2 8 3 9 1 10 ...

    read as **(rdkit_index_1_based, pdbqt_serial)** -- the SMILES index comes
    FIRST, which is the opposite of what the name suggests.

    MEASURED on danuglipron (41 heavy atoms, 42 PDBQT atoms incl. one polar H):
    reading the pairs as (serial, index) makes the ELEMENT agree on only
    **21 of 41** atoms; reading them as (index, serial) agrees on **41 of 41**.
    The tell is in the data itself -- the second number reaches 42 (a serial)
    while the first stops at 41 (an index into a 41-atom molecule).

    Getting this backwards does not fail loudly. It produces a mapping that
    `heavy_atom_mapping` then rejects as incomplete, returning `None`, so
    `restore_hydrogens` silently falls back to POSITIONAL order -- the exact
    failure this mapping exists to prevent. On danuglipron that returned the
    (R) enantiomer of an (S) drug.
