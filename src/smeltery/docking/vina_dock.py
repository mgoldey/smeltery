"""AutoDock Vina pose search, as tier 1 of a cost hierarchy.

## Where this sits

    tier 1  Vina (empirical)     26.4 s/lig    10^5-10^6 poses   SEARCH
    tier 2  MMFF / GFN-FF        2.2-21.6 ms   10^2-10^3         relax, declash
    tier 3  GFN2-xTB             0.05-0.152 s  10-10^2           rank
    tier 4  DFT + D3(BJ)         0.66-612 s    1-10              final energetics

    MEASURED 2026-09-19 (tiers.py; tier 1 from ferric RESULTS.md M11). The tier 1
    figure is PER LIGAND, not per pose -- the old `~10 us/pose` was the
    inner-loop cost and made docking look free when it is 79% of a
    campaign. Tier 4 spans 9 to 71 atoms at STO-3G.

Each tier exists to DISCARD, cheaply, what the next cannot afford to examine.
Vina's scoring is empirical and crude; that is fine, because only its POSES are
wanted here. The physics comes from the tiers above it.

## What Vina actually searches

6 rigid-body degrees of freedom plus the ligand's rotatable torsions (9 for
danuglipron), by Monte Carlo with BFGS local refinement. That is the same
~15-dimensional space a 4 ps GFN2 anneal failed to explore in 62 minutes, and
Vina covers it in seconds -- because its per-pose cost is ~5 orders of magnitude
lower. Cheap scoring is what MAKES a search possible.

## Honest limits

- The receptor is RIGID. Induced fit is not modelled.
- Vina's score is an empirical sum fitted to binding data. It is a pose-ranking
  heuristic, not a binding free energy, and it is NOT used as one here.
- A docking pose is a hypothesis. `redock_rmsd` against a known bound pose is
  the only way to know whether the search works on a given target, and it is
  the first thing this module should be used for.

    -- the same discipline `ferric's morph embedding` applies to ETKDG.

    `exhaustiveness` trades wall time for search thoroughness. Vina's own
    default is 8; ferric's signature said 32, which predates the measurement
    below. smeltery's default is `DEFAULT_EXHAUSTIVENESS` = 4.

    MEASURED (ferric RESULTS.md M11): across an 8x range of exhaustiveness the mean
    redock RMSD moved 0.097 A, which is SMALLER than the 0.131 A between-seed
    SEM, and ex=32 had the WORST mean of the four levels tried. The reasoning
    this docstring used to give -- "the failure being fixed is a SEARCH
    failure, so under-searching would reproduce it" -- is plausible and turned
    out to be wrong: what moved the number was the ETKDG SEED, not the search
    effort. Spend the budget on SEEDS, not exhaustiveness.

    `cpu` is Vina's thread count; **0 means "use every core on the box"**, which
    is its own default and the right choice when docking ONE ligand. It is the
    wrong choice for screening: Vina parallelizes across its internal search
    runs, so at low exhaustiveness it cannot even fill the cores it took
    ("WARNING: At low exhaustiveness, it may be impossible to utilize all
    CPUs"), and a sequential loop over N ligands then leaves the machine partly
    idle N times over. For a screen, pass `cpu=1` and fan out ACROSS ligands
    (`Stage(..., workers=k)`) -- ligands are fully independent, so that scales
    where the internal parallelism does not.

    Note the search result depends on `cpu` even at a fixed `seed`: Vina's
    threads race to fill the pose buffer, so thread count changes the outcome.
    Reproducibility therefore requires pinning `cpu` as well as `seed` -- a
    screen that varies core count between runs is not reproducible even with
    identical seeds.
