"""Cost model for the DFT tier — what actually drives its size.

PORTED from ferric's `tools/pipeline/cost.py` at commit 8637a5d (the commit
pinned in pyproject.toml). The DFT section below is that file's logic and
constants unchanged; every constant keeps the ferric source file it was read
from. The RHF section at the end is smeltery's own: the FieldInteraction tier
is RHF, which has no XC grid, so the DFT terms do not apply to it.

Quote any cost SHARE with its basis. The campaign split is 72.7% docking at
STO-3G but 39.8% docking / 60.0% DFT at the def2-svp default; a share without
its basis is not a number.

This module exists because of a REASONING error, not a coding one. The
campaign record twice claimed tier 4's blowup "is not a size effect" on the
grounds that a 234-basis-function job outran a 330-function one. That
comparison is void: in ferric, KS-DFT's grid is a flat 75x110 Becke-Lebedev
grid **per atom** (`crates/ferric-dft/src/grid.rs`), so the exchange-correlation
cost scales with ATOM COUNT and is independent of the basis set.

The practical consequence is counter-intuitive enough to be worth encoding:
**shrinking the basis can INCREASE resident memory**, because the AO cache is
`4 * nbf * npts * 8` bytes and `npts` is fixed by the geometry. Going from a
32-atom alkane at def2-SVP to a 70-atom drug at STO-3G cuts nbf by 0.71x but
raises npts by 2.19x, for a net 1.55x -- a bigger cache from a smaller basis.

Numbers here are structural (grid dimensions read from the Rust source), not
timings, so they carry no machine dependence.

        This is the term that actually sets KS-DFT wall time at drug scale.
        `vxc.rs` assembles V_xc with `buf.dot(&chi.t())`, an (nbf, npts) x
        (npts, nbf) GEMM. Since npts is proportional to atom count, this is
        cubic in molecular size -- and it is paid per iteration, not once.

        Calibrated against measured alkane runs (STO-3G/PBE, 10 iterations
        each), predicting from alkane_5 alone:

            atoms   predicted   actual
               32       17.8 s   19.6 s
               62      134.3 s  130.2 s

        Within 10% across a 54x span of cost.

        **This term is PER ITERATION; the iteration count is a separate
        factor and it is NOT constant across chemistries.** Every alkane
        converged in exactly 10 iterations, but danuglipron took **18**
        (measured 2026-09-02, 612.4 s, converged, on a verified-quiet box).
        So predicting a wall time needs BOTH factors:

            wall ~ xc_fock_work x (seconds per iteration) x (iterations)

        Scaling alkane_20's 130.2 s by work alone predicts 6.8 min and the
        actual is 10.2 min (1.50x). Multiply through by the real iteration
        ratio (18/10) instead and the per-iteration model lands within 20%,
        slightly conservative.

        `predicted_seconds` assumes a COMPARABLE iteration count and is
        therefore a LOWER BOUND for a molecule that converges more slowly than
        the reference. Do not quote it as a promised wall time; use
        `PyDftResult.iterations` from a real run to calibrate a new chemistry.
