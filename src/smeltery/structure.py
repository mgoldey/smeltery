"""Read a structure in whatever format you have, get a `ferric.Molecule`.

## Why this module exists

ferric's Rust core accepts exactly one input format. `Molecule` (in
`crates/ferric-core/src/mol.rs`) exposes `load_xyz`, `load_xyz_with_charge`
and `parse_xyz` -- and nothing else. There is no Rust-side PDB, SDF, mol2 or
SMILES reader, and adding one would mean reimplementing, in Rust, chemistry
that `gemmi` and `rdkit` already do correctly.

So this module converts *in Python* and hands the result to the Rust parser
that already exists. Every path below ends at the same place:

    <your format> --> (symbols, coords in Angstrom) --> Molecule.from_xyz_string

That single funnel is deliberate. It means a PDB and an XYZ of the same
molecule produce a **bit-identical** `Molecule`, because they go through the
same Angstrom->Bohr conversion in the same Rust code, rather than through two
parsers that could drift apart. `test_all_formats_agree_bitwise` pins it.

## What you need installed

`import smeltery.structure` needs neither `ferric` nor a backend: ferric is
imported lazily in `Structure.to_molecule`, and gemmi / RDKit only when a
reader that needs them runs.

| format             | backend | availability                       |
|--------------------|---------|------------------------------------|
| `.xyz`             | builtin | always                             |
| `.pdb`, `.cif`     | gemmi   | `pip install 'smeltery[gemmi]'`    |
| `.pqr`             | builtin | always                             |
| `.gro`             | builtin | always                             |
| `.sdf`, `.mol`     | rdkit   | `pip install 'smeltery[rdkit]'`    |
| `.mol2`            | rdkit   | `pip install 'smeltery[rdkit]'`    |
| SMILES (string)    | rdkit   | `pip install 'smeltery[rdkit]'`    |

A missing backend raises `MissingBackend` naming the extra to install, rather
than a bare `ModuleNotFoundError` from three frames down.

## What `charge` and `multiplicity` mean here

`charge` is the **total** molecular charge in units of the elementary charge:
the net number of electrons removed. `-1` for an anion such as a deprotonated
carboxylate, `+1` for a protonated amine, `0` for a neutral molecule. It is
*not* a sum of per-atom formal charges from a drawing -- those can be nonzero
on a neutral zwitterion and would give the wrong electron count.

`multiplicity` is the **spin multiplicity 2S+1**, not the number of unpaired
electrons and not S itself. This is the convention ferric's Rust core uses
(`Molecule.multiplicity`, `crates/ferric-core/src/mol.rs`) and the one Gaussian,
Q-Chem, ORCA and PySCF's `spin=2S` all relate to, so the values you already
know carry over:

    multiplicity  2S+1   unpaired e-   name        typical case
    1             1      0             singlet     nearly every closed-shell molecule
    2             2      1             doublet     a radical; any odd-electron species
    3             3      2             triplet     O2 ground state, many carbenes
    4             4      3             quartet     e.g. high-spin d3 metal centres

**1 (singlet) is right for most closed-shell organic molecules and wrong for
every radical.** There is deliberately no default, so you have to say it.

ferric checks this, so half the mistakes are caught for you.
`validate_electron_multiplicity_parity` (`crates/ferric-core/src/mol.rs:65`)
runs inside `parse_xyz` -- which is the entry point everything in this module
funnels into -- and requires `n_alpha = (nelec + multiplicity - 1) / 2` to be a
non-negative integer. Two ways to fail it:

- **Wrong parity.** `nelec` and `multiplicity` must be of *opposite* parity: an
  odd electron count demands an even multiplicity (doublet, quartet) and vice
  versa. A radical left at the default multiplicity 1 is arithmetically
  impossible and raises, rather than computing something meaningless.
- **More unpaired electrons than electrons.** `multiplicity - 1 > nelec` also
  raises.

**What the check cannot catch is the case that matters most.** An even-electron
species whose true ground state is a **triplet** -- O2 is the textbook example,
and many carbenes and transition-metal complexes follow it -- passes parity at
multiplicity 1 without complaint, and the SCF converges neatly to a state that
does not exist. No format records spin, and no validator can infer it. That one
is on you.

## Neither is guessed from the file

Every reader takes both explicitly: `charge` and `multiplicity` are REQUIRED
arguments of `read`, `read_structure` and `Structure`, with no default, so
forgetting them is a `TypeError` rather than a silent neutral singlet. Formats differ wildly in how (and whether)
they record them: PDB records neither, SDF has a charge block that counts only
*formal* charges, and a SMILES string carries formal charges but says nothing
about spin state. **No common structure format records multiplicity at all**,
which is precisely why it must be an argument rather than something inferred.

Guessing charge would silently produce the wrong number of electrons, and an
SCF on the wrong charge converges happily to a meaningless answer.

The one exception is `from_smiles`, which reads the formal charge off the
RDKit molecule *because the string states it explicitly* -- and it still lets
you override, and still never guesses multiplicity.

## SMILES needs a geometry, and this gives you a crude one

`from_smiles` runs ETKDG embedding plus an MMFF cleanup. That is a *starting
geometry*, not an optimized one -- tier 2 of the cost hierarchy. Feeding it straight to DFT wastes the DFT. Run
it through xtb first.
