"""Build a molecule from a KNOWN topology and write coordinates onto it.

## Why this exists

Perceiving bonds from coordinates (`rdDetermineBonds.DetermineConnectivity`)
uses INTERATOMIC DISTANCE ALONE and enforces no valence rule. On a docked pose
-- strained and close-packed by construction -- it bridges atoms that are near
but not bonded.

MEASURED 2026-09-21 on 8 Vina poses of danuglipron in 7LCJ, each already
re-hydrogenated to the correct 71-atom molecule: **8/8 came back chemically
impossible**, with carbons of degree 5-6 and hydrogens carrying two bonds.

The damage is silent and downstream. `Chem.RemoveHs(mol, sanitize=False)`
cannot drop a 2-bonded "hydrogen", so the perceived graph carried 43 heavy
atoms where the molecule has 41, and `rdFMCS.FindMCS` matched only **19 of 41
(27%)** in a molecule paired with ITSELF -- where the MCS is by definition the
whole molecule. The unmatched 73% then re-embedded freely, ~6 A away.

When the topology is already known -- and it always is, because the SMILES is
what produced the pose -- there is nothing to perceive. Build from SMILES,
write the coordinates on, and assert the graph.

    mol = mol_with_coords(smiles, symbols, coords)   # 100% MCS coverage

## The assertions are the point

`assert_graph_is_sane` is cheap and catches exactly the failure above:
no hydrogen with more than one bond, no carbon above degree four, and a
heavy-atom count that matches the declared topology. All three fire on the
distance-perceived poses; all three pass here.
