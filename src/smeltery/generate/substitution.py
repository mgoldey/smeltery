"""Propose viable substitutions at a drug active site, scored RELATIVELY.

## What the danuglipron prototype established (2026-09-19)

Run against the real parent (PubChem CID 134611040) and the real receptor
(7LCJ, GLP-1R), 9 aromatic CH sites x 6 substituents = 54 analogues:

| stage | result |
|---|---|
| enumerate | 54 analogues |
| pharmacophore gate | 54 kept, **0 rejected** |
| absolute Lipinski/Veber | **0 clean**, 54 flagged |

Both cheap gates were useless, for OPPOSITE reasons, and neither is a bug:

* The pharmacophore gate rejected nothing because substituting an aromatic CH
  genuinely cannot break an acid, a fused diazole, a basic amine or a nitrile.
  Confirmed reachable by feeding it molecules that MUST fail (a methyl ester
  broke `acid_or_bioisostere`; benzene and ethanol broke all four), so 0/54 is
  a true negative. That gate belongs on SCAFFOLD moves -- `bioisostere_swaps`,
  `ring_contractions` -- where those features are actually at risk.
* The absolute liability gate rejected everything because **the parent already
  violates it**: danuglipron is MW 555.6, cLogP 4.89. It is a Phase-2 clinical
  compound. The rule of 5 is a hit-finding filter; applied to an optimized
  molecule it is a constant, not a discriminator.

What discriminated was the CHANGE each substitution makes:

    subst    dMW   dcLogP   verdict
    CN     +25.0    -0.13   the only one that LOWERS lipophilicity
    OMe    +30.0    +0.01   marginal
    F      +18.0    +0.14
    Me     +14.0    +0.31
    Cl     +34.4    +0.65
    CF3    +68.0    +1.02   worst, against a parent already at 4.89

So this module enumerates and scores RELATIVE to the parent. That is the same
argument as reporting ddE rather than an absolute binding energy at the QM
tier: for lead OPTIMIZATION, every gate must be relative, because the absolute
is dominated by the scaffold you are not changing.

## What this module deliberately does NOT do

No docking, no xtb, no QM. Those are later tiers (`smeltery.tiers`,
`smeltery.docking`, `smeltery.pocket`); this produces the POPULATION they
narrow. See `wiki/substitution-pipeline-danuglipron-2026-09-19.md` for the full
stage list and the four blockers (unwritten pose geometry -- since fixed in
PR #93 -- missing dispersion, pose noise, and the missing connector).

    `active_site.prescreen.batch_prescreen`,
    `active_site.binding_energy.compute_binding_energy` -- needs coordinates.

    `seed` is FIXED by default. ETKDG is stochastic, and an unseeded embedding
    makes every downstream energy irreproducible. This uses
    the same seeded ETKDG + MMFF recipe as `smeltery.tiers.PairedPoses`.

    The geometry is ETKDG + (by default) an MMFF cleanup: a TIER-2 STARTING
    STRUCTURE, not an optimized one. Feeding it straight to DFT wastes the DFT.
    In the real pipeline this feeds docking (tier 1) or xtb (tier 3) first --
    see `wiki/substitution-pipeline-danuglipron-2026-09-19.md` for the stage
    list and the measured costs.

    Every input yields exactly one output, in order. A proposal that cannot be
    embedded comes back with `coords=None` and an `error`, never absent.

    **THESE COORDINATES ARE CENTRED ON THE ORIGIN, so they cannot go straight
    into a pocket.** ETKDG builds a molecule in its own frame; a pocket derived
    from a PDB sits at its crystal coordinates. MEASURED on 7LCJ: the two are
    **226 A apart**. Handing these to `run_rhf(point_charges=...)` or
    `compute_binding_energy` is NOT an error -- the SCF converges and returns a
    confident ~0.00 kcal/mol interaction, a gas-phase answer wearing a QM/MM
    label.

    To score a proposal in a pocket you need a POSE, which means docking it:
    `dock_ligand` returns `DockedPose.coords_angstrom` in the receptor's frame,
    and `funnel._harvest_geometry` carries that into `context["geometry"]` so
    tiers 3 and 4 score the docked pose instead of re-embedding. This function
    is for enumeration and gas-phase work.
