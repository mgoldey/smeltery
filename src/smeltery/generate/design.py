"""Designed structural analogues of a lead compound, and the pharmacophore
constraint they must respect.

GENERIC LIBRARY. The types here describe *how* to express a set of designed
analogues; they contain no molecule. A specific campaign's hypothesis set lives
with that campaign, in `experiments/<name>/`, and is passed in.

## The shape of an analogue set

Each `Analogue` pairs a structure with the liability hypothesis it tests and the
`PharmacophoreSpec` it must not break. A set should also contain **negative
controls** — variants that break exactly one pharmacophore feature on purpose —
because without them a fit or liability metric cannot be shown to discriminate
anything. See `Analogue.is_negative_control`.

## Ionization state is part of the design, not a detail

`Analogue.smiles_ionized`/`net_charge` carry the species that exists at
physiological pH. This is load-bearing: scoring a neutral acid when the bound
species is an anion omitted ~143 kcal/mol of the interaction under study in one
campaign (see `experiments/danuglipron/RESULTS.md`), and made a
cannot-ionize control look equivalent to its parent.

## Honesty boundary

An analogue is a *hypothesis expressed as a structure*. Nothing here is a claim
about what happens in an organism.

    `is_negative_control=True` marks a variant designed to BREAK a
    pharmacophore feature on purpose. These are kept in the set so the fit
    metric can be shown to discriminate: a control that deletes the potency
    anchor and still scores as well as the parent means the metric is not
    measuring complementarity. Per CLAUDE.md's protocol, this is the stated
    artifact hypothesis made executable — and it earned its place, catching
    three independent errors in one campaign (see
    experiments/danuglipron/RESULTS.md).

    On what a failure means: the original guess was "measuring size or noise".
    Measured 2026-08-29, SIZE is ruled out (r(MW, fit) = +0.132). NOISE was real
    but fixable (SEM 6.5 kcal/mol at n=40). What remains is pose determination.

    `smiles_ionized` / `net_charge` carry the state the molecule is actually IN
    at physiological pH, and they are the ones that must be scored.

    WHY THIS FIELD EXISTS (measured 2026-08-29, and it invalidated a whole run):
    a carboxylic acid with pKa ~4 is **anionic** at pH 7.4, and that anion is
    the salt bridge that anchors it. Scoring the NEUTRAL acid in a protein
    point-charge field gave −22.86 kcal/mol; the ANION at the SAME geometry gave
    **−165.81** kcal/mol. Modelling everything as neutral therefore omitted ~143
    kcal/mol of exactly the interaction under study, and made a cannot-ionize
    control look equivalent to its parent. An ionization state is not a detail;
    it is the measurement.
